there is no campus , and university buildings are dotted around the town . conference sessions will take place in the hoveniersberg , overlooking the bovenschelde in one of the quiet parts of town . programme conference sessions will start on the morning of the wednesday and last a full three days . it is envisaged that most participants will arrive and register on the tuesday evening . our provisional programme looks like this : tuedsday 8 sept 15 . 00 onwards : registration wednesday 9 sept 08 . 30 - 09 . 30 : late registration 09 . 45 : opening of conference 10 . 00 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pre-booked dinner 20 . 15 : drinks reception thursday 10 sept 08 . 30 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pala agm 20 . 00 : pre-booked dinner friday 11 sept 08 . 30 - 17 . 00 : conference sessions 17 . 15 : wind-up session evening : activities to be arranged there will be continuous coffee , tea , etc . throughout the conference sessions . accommodation rooms in the vermeylen student hall of residence , a couple of hundred metres from the conference centre , are available to all participants . it is possible to book rooms for several nights either side of the conference dates . the price on the registration form includes breakfast . unfortunately , no double rooms are available . if you would prefer to stay in a hotel , we recommend the arcade hotel ( nederkouter , 9000 gent ;

( 1b ) above ] . lrules ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural facts ) are typically learned or acquired by experience . but some norms are so deeply rooted in human nature that their violation is more or less unnatural and requires an extra effort . ( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i \\' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the \\' two-leg \\' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit is there to making such a distinction > at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians \\' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland\\n',\n",

       " \"Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations\\n\\ni agree with mark durie that it is less curious that chomsky is cited so much than that others before him are cited so little , at least by linguists . for example , two of the most important issues in multilinear phonology , one fairly recent , the other around since the 70 's , are many-to - one mapping between tones and vowels and * prosodic licensing * , the notion that elements of one linguistic level must belong to units of a higher level ( usually the next level up ) . both of these notions are explicit principles of tagmemic phonology ( on the first cf . the last two paragraphs of pike & pike 1947 , then read the first line of the introduction to goldsmith 's 1976 phd thesis for an interesting contrast ; on the second principle , cf . pike 1967 and his discussion of the ` phonemic hierarchy ' ) . one rarely sees pike quoted in this regard ( e . selkirk has long been an exception to this pattern , though ) . geoff pullum 's nllt column on citation etiquette in linguistics takes up this general problem . this is partially understandable since a lot of tagmemics ' insights take the unappealing form of a disjoint set of ad-hoc commentaries on the last language pike looked at . nevertheless , there is no way to deny that pike is responsible for some brilliant insights into human language . and pike is just one example . there are plenty of others . it is not that anyone needs chomsky to make their work respectable . that is clearly false , whether the individual is saussure or a student . still , if anyone were to seriously doubt that it is chomsky , not saussure , nor bloomfield , nor sapir , nor even jakobson , who ` put linguistics on the map ' of the intellectual disciplines and who has done more to keep it there than anyone else is in need of some psychiatric help . moreover , the fact that chomsky publishes more than any other linguist ( if i am wrong , please correct me - that would be interesting ) does n't hurt his citation index . his output is nearly asimovian . his influence on the field can be seen even at the level of university administration : when a department chairperson wants to convince a university administrator that linguistics has natural intellectual ties to many departments , i do not think that they would drop the names of saussure or pike rather than chomsky . it is worth considering the possibility that many of the citations of chomsky 's work could be due to ignorance - if he said it , or even if we think he did , just cite him and nobody will argue ; why look for the * original * source ? that 's hard work and laziness too often prevails . but it is also true that , like it or not , the source of many of the most interesting ideas in history on human language came from 20d-219 , mit .\\n\",\n",

( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor \\'s much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c \\'s theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c \\'s views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in \" the mind \\'s new science \" , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in \" aspects \" and in the non-technical parts of \" knowledge of language \" . it \\'s surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into \" government and binding \" . - philip swann\\n',\n",

bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi \\'s tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris \\'s approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out \" i \\' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john \\'s class . \" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on \" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase \" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n\\'t invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n\\'t accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won\\'t be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) \" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . \" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said \" descriptive \" but the publisher substituted the buzzword \" structural . \" i recall him saying , amusedly , \" i do n\\'t remember whether they asked me or not . \" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky \\'s followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n\\'t think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the \" transformational revolution . \" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris \" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , \" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky \\'s ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley \\'s review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris \\'s operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris \\'s work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris \\'s grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like \" someone was opposed by everyone . \" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris \\'s selected writings , asked \" why bother ? \" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris \\'s program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris \\'s work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley \\'s witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris \\'s intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the \" constructional procedure \" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one \\'s control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) \" he did n\\'t really mean that . \" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris \\'s later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the \" background vernacular \" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i \\' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one \\'s biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in \" why phonology is n\\'t natural . \" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris \\'s endeavor was always , then , to determine a \" least grammar , \" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists \\' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein \\'s assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life \\'s work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying \" ok , i \\' m ready now . \" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com\\n',\n",

\" he queried . responses to raskin \\'s question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called \" linguistnet \" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee \\'s curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee \\'s attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition \\'s organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee \\'s decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into \" linguistnet \" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . \" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher \" , she said wednesday . \" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . \" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents \\' accent . many others agreed . \" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , \" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . \" but all their children had strong \\' towny \\' accents . \" \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , \" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . \" kids get their accents from their peers , \" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher \\'s english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . \" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , \" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . \" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . \" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we \\' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : \" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of \" consonants and wowels , \" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she \\'d listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher \\'s accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ?

       " 'Subject: accents in classroom\\n\\ni received a number of helpful and informative responses from a few colleagues and i am grateful to all of them . below please find a digest of the responses . first of all , barbara partee provided the background information on the case itself , which was playing out practically in her own backyard . on july 7 , 1992 , barbara partee ( partee @ cs . umass . edu ) wrote to me : \" i \\' m keeping an eye on the westfield accent uproar because it \\'s not far from here and there \\'s something about it in the paper almost every day , including editorials . i \\' ll be glad to help keep you updated on news , and i would appreciate receiving any references you find out about to research that shows that the parents have nothing to worry about . ( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph \" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good \" model \" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . \" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades \" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . \" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city \\'s school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state \\'s secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal \" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . \" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as \" bovine scatology . \" the state \\'s attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state \\'s anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i \\' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday \\'s nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , \" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . \" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there \\'s a great deal of debate about whether it \\'s racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? \" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : \" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners \\' request . i \\' ll know more by this evening \\'s news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i \\' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . \" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners \\' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners \\' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . \" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : \" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher \\'s foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ?

       " 'Subject: george aditjondro\\n\\ndr george aditjondro , a prominent indonesian academic at satya wacana university in salatiga , central java , remains at risk of imminent arrest for his peaceful academic and political activities . he was not arrested on 8 october because he was not in the country at the time . he has since returned , and on 12 october , dr aditjondro received a second summons on charges of \" insulting a government authority or body \" , under article 207 of the indonesian criminal code , a charge which carries a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment . if detained , dr aditjondro would be a prisoner of conscience . the second summons requires him to report to yogyakarta police at 10am on 15 october . it does not clarify whether dr aditjondro is wanted as a witness or a suspect . if held and questioned as a suspect , dr aditjondro could face prosecution and imprisonment . the pretext for the charge against dr aditjondro appears to arise from comments he made during a panel discussion at the universitas islam indonesia ( uii ) in yogyakarta in august . amnesty international believes , however , that the authorities are attempting to punish dr aditjondro for his past criticism of government policy relating to human rights and environmental concerns in indonesia and east timor and , further , that the charge may be intended to prevent him from taking part in peaceful activities prior to and during the asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) meetings which will be held in jakarta in mid - november . amnesty international is also concerned that , since the issuance of the first summons on 5 october , dr aditjondro has been subjected to intensive surveillance by military intelligence officers from the resort military command ( korem ) in salatiga , both at his home and his place of work . under indonesia \\'s code of criminal procedure ( kuhap ) , the police and not the military , bear sole responsibility for the arrest of suspects . since military intelligence authorities have no lawful role to play in dr aditjondro \\'s case , amnesty international considers their activities in recent days to be a form of harassment . background information the charge against dr george aditjondro is symptomatic of a marked escalation in official harassment and intimidation of alleged government critics in recent months . these measures have included prevention or breaking up of meetings and seminars , the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists , and the torture or ill-treatment of some political detainees . human rights violations against labour activists are a part of this pattern . muchtar pakpahan , the chairman of the independent trade union , sbsi , is currently on trial along with at least nine others , accused of \" inciting \" workers to demonstrate and to strike . amnesty international believes that use of these measures against alleged government critics has increased in preparation for the apec meetings in november , which will attract considerable international and domestic media coverage . further recommended action : please send telegrams / faxes / express and airmail letters : - expressing concern that dr george aditjondro remains in imminent danger of arrest for the peaceful expression of his views ;

       " 'Subject: language evolution context\\n\\nhello to all linguist - s ! i am \" lurking \" to ( proper use ? ) your conversations since now a good year , but , not being a linguist myself , i usually do not talk a lot . first , as a teacher of french language in taiwan , i must tell how much i feel listening to this list really brings me a lot . specially as i hold a non-prescriptive view of my own language ( contrary , i think , to the majority of teachers ( ? ) , and certainly to our embattled french ministre de la culture , mr toubon , that a lot of people in france now usually call mr . \" allgood \" : ) . i was prompted to write by the problem of the evolution of languages . . . so it is not so far from my allusion to mr . toubon with with i opened my message . . . it seems to me obvious that , ( apart from phonological evolution ) a language may evolve , at the morpho-systactic level , from acculturation , that is , influence of another , ( \" dominant \" or not ) language , in historical times , close geographically , but also through commercial contacts ( the modern times is another story - what does mean \" close \" when i can talk with you from taiwan ? ) . but i think the matter is quite more complicated that all that has been mentionned so far . . . first the chinese case seems to me very complicated and specific : a - there is a chinese \" isolat \" for about 4000 years ( quite no interaction with other cultures , except the bouddhist indian one , where it gave rise to a quite specific \" sub-language \" , mainly phonetic transcription of samskrit words into adapted-on - purpose chinese characters , but which has little to do with generic chinese , b - there is a feed-back from the ideographs , so that chinese language does n\\'t evolve independantly from its writing since a long time , c - because the phonologic evolution of the spoken language is not directly reflected onto the writing system , which builts upon its own logic , it is possible that its laws of evolution could be very different from languages using alphabetic or syllabic systems of notation ( ? ) . more : my french is certainly influenced by the english i use on internet , and the chinese i use in day-to - day life ( to the point that i sometimes realise that , while talking to my sister in france by phone , i find myself unthinkingly telling her : \" j \\' habite dans une petite hsiang derriere l \\' ecole . \" ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( i live in a little hsiang just behind the school - - \" hsiang \" being the chinese for a little alley connected to a main street ) . and having to apologize and reexplain . . . but i mainly switch between the languages , and there is little chance i create my own pidgin or creole . . . so do many taiwanese ( min-nan ) speaking people in the south of the island . . . so does it not mean that the evolution should depend on the education level of people - so that it would be differential inside a society according to , say , the social class ? there is probably as well a \" critical mass effect \" ( if france was turned into some chinese-dominant state . . . ) . is not our idea of \" homogeneity \" in evolution vitiated by the pretention of modern nation-states to generate a \" super-culture \" - through linguistic homogeneisation ? ) - i am also aware of phenomenons of resistance to acculturative evolution ( conscious or not ) as for the quebecquois telling , not \" un hot-dog \" as the french do , but \" un chien chaud \" ( toubon being in my opinion but a marginal impedement on the natural evolution , whatever direction it takes ) . . . - another exemple of the complexity of those issue would be the \" rigidification \" of a language facing a threat . it was given to me as an explanation when i was a student of kurdish , when i learnt that this language has in common with old persian an \" ergative \" ( ? ) construction for transitive verbs in past tenses , which was presented to me as a \" quite - passive \" construction . to allow for comparisons by more knowledgeable people , i will explain a little : there , the infix representing the agent is appended at the end of the verb , while the infix representing the subject is appended after the object , as : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xuward - 0 ( - eke and ek ( [ ^ e ] k ) being suffixes expressing definiteness ( eke = the ) ( child-the apple-one - he ate ) and indefiniteness respectively ( ek = a ) ) here , - y represents the child , - 0 a null infix ( there is only one apple ) , so \" the child ate the apples \" would be : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xiward-n < - - - - \" - n \" : there are several apples ( child-the apples-the - he ate-them ) so i was told at this time that this construct , which was used in old persian ( and is still used in the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan , is an archaic construction , characteristic of the periphery of the indo-iranian domain , that is , in kurdistan ( south-kurmandji , or sorani-speaking part ) , and also among the baluches , and represents a rigidification of the language due to a threat from other languages , ( so that languages at a domain periphery would sometimes evolve more slowly ) and that it has disappeared from standard modern persian . . . i would want to know if all that is still considered true , though . what do you think of it ? i guess there are as well different levels of evolution taking place simultaneously , that can be contradictory ( phonology , vocabulary , syntax . . . ) . anyway , i see several reasons why it should be difficult to infer any \" linear \" evolution of languages ( whatever fascination i feel when i read posts speaking of modelisations of 10 or 20 000 years back . . . ) on anything else that a case-by - case basis ( or does the fact that populations densities has obviously undergone a dramatic change since then , changing the dynamics of contacts . . . ? ? ? ? ) . to resume my questions : how can we ascertain that this language has had this reaction without having to resort to extra-linguistic implicit hypothesis as : homogeneity through classes , identity of evolution whatever the number of speakers would be ( lng-switching vs creolisation . . . ) , existence ( or not ) , type , and evolution of a scripting system ( * * ) etc . . . ?

- in other words , as if there had been leftists ( in the us ) who applied the term to themselves without irony . now , what had been something of an inside leftwing joke has been turned into a weapon brandished against the left . for example , in 1982 , say , a leftist might have blown off steam about some dogmatic person or organization by characterizing her or it as \" politically correct . \" but now i hear the term used by non-leftists , often to evoke an image of rigid leftist / multi-culturalist / academic types taking over our institutions and seeking to control our minds - - as if such a move were afoot , and as if the left had that much power . at this point , if \" politically correct \" ever regains an ironic connotation , perhaps it will be as a word that makes fun of the political right . for example , sometimes i hear people call each other \" commie \" or \" pinko \" in a manner whose real intent is to make fun of the prejudices of anti-communists . i could imagine that \" politically correct \" might one day be used similarly . sincerely , seth\\n',\n",

       " \"Subject: summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology )\\n\\nlast week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .\\n\",\n",

( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it \\'s different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it \\'s especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that \\'s because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i \\' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really \\'s now \\' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ?

       " \"Subject: typological classification\\n\\na few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )\\n\",\n",
       " 'Subject: sum : dets and number\\n\\nabout a month ago , i posted the following query : i \\' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english \" the \" , \" some \" , \" john \\'s \" , as opposed to \" this \" , \" these \" ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n\\'t satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . \" kucing \" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners \" itu \" ( that / the ) and ini \" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . \" seekor kucing itu \" ( that / the one cat ) , \" dua ekor kucing itu \" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with \" itu \" and ini \" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . \" kucing itu \" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . \" cat \" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as \" john \\'s \" are unmarked for number , eg . \" john \\'s one cat \" ( john \\'s one cat ) , \" john \\'s two cat ( s ) \" ( john \\'s two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . \" john \\'s cat \" ( john \\'s cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article \" the \" exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by \" the one cat \" , \" the two cat ( s ) \" ) , \" the cat \" is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: lx as * science * ?\\n\\ni accept the editors \\' recent challenge for resuming last year \\'s thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 \\'s when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i \\' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists \\' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it \\'s * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n\\'t there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where \\'s our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can\\'t stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic \\' attractors \\' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein \\'s relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a \" pseudo-science \" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n\\'t need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : \" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval \\'s most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be \\'s cientific \\' - - then it had to be \\' logical \\' \" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , \" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? \" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a \\'s hamanic stance \\' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as \\' cause \\' and \\'d etermine \\' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( \" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . \" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word \\' karma \\' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the \\' comes around \\' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning \\'d irect object of verb \\' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < \" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round \" > < - - john lennon >\\n',\n",

the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 -

drop analysis of rizzi ( 1994 ) . we argue contra sano & hyams ( 1994 ) that these missing subjects are instances of pro , not pro , and demonstrate that the economy-based pro-drop theory of speas ( 1994 ) handles our data in an elegant fashion . the analysis we propose links the acquisition of subjects to the acquisition of functional morphology , in accordance with the minimalist program developed since chomsky ( 1989 ) . one desirable consequence of the approach taken here is that no recourse to a pro-drop parameter is necessary . ircs-94 -

       " 'Subject: typological method\\n\\npace fritz newmeyer , there has been extensive discussion of the methodological issues that he raises . ( these remarks are independent of any assessment of johanna nichol \\'s book that fritz referred to , incidentally . ) first , good typological work devotes a substantial amount of effort to defining and delimiting what sorts of constructions should or should not belong to a particular structural type . good examples are many of dryer \\'s papers ( e . g . dryer 1989a , 1989b , 1992 ) , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 : ch . 1 - 3 on nominalizations , stassen 1985 : ch . 2 , 4 on comparative and \\' chaining \\' constructions , and haspelmath 1993 : ch . 2 on indefinite pronouns . more generally , the discussion of the proper typological markedness criteria in croft 1990 : ch . 4 - 6 is an attempt to provide some * general * structural criteria for a large class of cross-linguistic phenomena ( see for example the formulation of the structural consequences of hopper & thompson 1980 \\'s transitivity hypothesis on p . 131 , or the application of the criteria to the syntactic category problem in croft 1991 : ch . 2 - 3 ) . delimiting and classifying the phenomena to be analyzed is not a simple descriptive task ; in fact , it raises some of the most interesting issues in typological analysis , and have hardly been ignored in the typological literature . second , with respect to basicness for a language type in particular , in the passage from croft 1990 that fritz referred to ( pp . 33-36 ) , i argued that typologists had moved from classifying languages typologically to classifying constructions typologically , and that that was a good thing . nevertheless , i suggested some general criteria for determining a \" basic \" language type . and despite my reservations about identifying \" basic \" language types , it has to be said that in the great majority of cases , defining a \" language type \" instead of a \" construction type \" is not terribly difficult . matthew dryer ( p . c . ) has observed that inspection of texts generally tells you very quickly what the \" word order type \" of a language is . in my own experience , in a study where i am comparing the syntax of prenominal and postnominal modifiers , i am quite frustrated at how difficult it is to find languages where a modifier freely occurs both pre - and postnominally . of course , identification of \" basic \" or other types depends on what resources you have available to you ( quality of grammatical descriptions , availability of texts / language consultants etc . ) as well as what phenomenon you are studying ( e . g . word order or head marking [ easier ] vs . relative order of modifiers or the syntax of nonrestrictive modification [ harder ] ) . but for most studies it is not an insurmountable problem , although there always some problematic cases . third , the sampling problem * has * been discussed at some length by typologists ( besides bell 1978 \\'s seminal article , see also dryer 1989c , perkins 1989 , croft 1990 : 18-25 , rijkhoff et al . 1993 ) . the issues are too complex to go into here at length . but it should be pointed out that the issues fritz raises apply to different sorts of samples with different purposes in mind . the question of how independent particular instances are have to do with probability samples ( see in particular the dryer , perkins and croft references for discussion of these problems ) . note in particular that the stability of the phenomenon being studied is an important factor : the less stable it is , the more likely cases are historically independent . the question of coming across rare types pertains to variety samples ( see in particular rijkhoff et al . ) . some studies ( e . g . tomlin 1986 , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 , haspelmath 1993 ) draw on a very large variety sample and then select a stratified probability sample from it for the appropriate generalizations . dryer \\'s sampling technique attempts to combine the needs of variety and probability samples into a single sampling procedure . i should also add that with the shift towards dynamic ( diachronic ) interpretations of synchronic typological patterns , the examination of cognate phenomena in related languages , and the comparison of \" nonbasic \" as well as basic typological strategies , becomes another important method of analysis . that means that to some extent , the problems of basic vs . nonbasic types in a single language , and of historical relatedness of data sets , can be avoided - - - in fact , exploited - - - in modern typological analysis . bill croft references : bell , alan . 1978 . language samples . universals of human language , vol . 1 : method and theory , ed . joseph h . greenberg , charles a . ferguson and edith a . moravcsik , 123-156 . stanford : stanford university press . croft , william . 1990 . typology and universals . cambridge : cambridge university press . - . 1991 . syntactic categories and grammatical relations : the cognitive organization of information . chicago : university of chicago press . dryer , matthew . 1989a . plural words . linguistics 27 . 865-95 . - . 1989b . article - noun order . cls 25 . 84-97 . - . 1989c . large linguistic areas and language sampling . studies in language 13 . 257-92 . - . 1992 . the greenbergian word order correlations . language 68 : 81 - 138 . hopper , paul and sandra a . thompson . 1980 . transitivity in grammar and discourse . language 56 . 251-299 . koptjevskaja - tamm , maria . 1988 . a typology of action nominal constructions . stockholm : university of stockholm . perkins , revere d . 1989 . statistical techniques for determining language sample size . studies in languagea013 : 293-315 . rijkhoff , jan , dik bakker , kees hengveld & peter kahrel . a method of language sampling . studies in language 17 . 169-203 . stassen , leon . 1985 . comparison and universal grammar . oxford : basil blackwell . tomlin , russell . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . dept of linguistics , u manchester , oxford rd , manchester m13 9pl , uk w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk fax : + 44-61 - 275 3187 phone : 275 3188\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology )\\n\\nfritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols \\' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie \\'s textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one \\'s sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing \\' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols \\' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language \\' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language \\' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n\\'t appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols \\' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols \\' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists \\' goal is not pigeon-holing ( \" taxonomy \" is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews\\n',\n",
       " \"Subject: comparative method\\n\\nthe recent discussion of limitations on the comparative method contained several assertions that such limitations had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of remote relationships , including amerind and nostratic . to my knowledge this is absolutely false . in every instance that i am aware of in which perceived temporal limitations on the comparative method have been mentioned , it is by way of explaining why it is there are no relationships beyond a certain degree of remoteness on which there is consensus , or by way of making predictions as to what historical linguistics will ultimately be able to achieve . i do not know of a single instance in which someone has argued : such and such a proposed relationship is associated with a time-depth of x years . this exceeds the temporal limits of the comparative method . therefore the proposal must be wrong . if anyone can provide evidence of such an argument being made i would be most interested . in the particular case of amerind , the objections have been two-fold : ( a ) the data is riddled with errors ; ( b ) the argument is not of a sort that most historical linguists consider probative . since greenberg and ruhlen do not apply the comparative method disbelief in their claims could not rationally be based on perceived limitations of the comparative method , nor has it been . ironically , even if greenberg and ruhlen did attempt to apply the comparative method , amerind would not provide a very good instance of the above hypothetical argument . since even conservative estimates of the time-depth possible with the comparative method range from 6-10ky , cand since greenberg and ruhlen adhere to the low chronology for the peopling of the americas that places it at roughly 12ky bp , their date for amerind does not radically exceed the perceived limits of the comparative method . in sum , whatever the validity of proposed temporal limits on the comparative method , and i agree that such limits are far from exact , the view that this has anything to do with reactions to greenberg 's work on amerind and similar work is a red-herring . to evaluate such proposals , look at the data and look at the methodology , not at the alleged ( and generally unknowable ) motivations of the critics . you 'd think that the irrelevance of ad hominem arguments except in matters of credibility of witnesses would not need to be repeated constantly . bill poser bill poser , first nations studies , university of northern british columbia , 3333 university way , prince george , british columbia , v2n 4z9 , canada 604-960 - 6692\\n\",\n",

       " 'Subject: eskimo words for \" snow \" , \" ice \" , etc .\\n\\nas an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury \\'s and hill \\'s recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can\\'t track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean \" ice \" , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean \" ice \" . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want \" words \" ) for \" ice \" than for \" snow \" . for the definition of a \" word \" and \" stem \" in eskimo , i refer y \\' all back to woodbury \\'s statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: eskimo snow in context\\n\\nas the quotation from whorf shows , he was concerned with the issue of whether there is a general term like \\'s now \\' in eskimo languages , not with whether eskimo ( or english ) have a multitude of specialized terms . it may be useful to point out that in the second half of the 19th century and thereafter one of the big issues concerning linguists and anthropologists was whether \" primitive \" people and their \" primitive \" languages possessed abstract terms . i think that we must view whorf \\'s and others \\' preoccupations in this context . ( it may be of interest to add that the other great issues regarding \" primitive \" languages was whether they possess clearly defined sounds , since it was widely claimed that speakersof such languages \" alternate \" between different pronunications . it was boas who showed that this was an illusion , but i think that many people would not listen , and that works such as sapir \\'s paper on the sound pattenrs and even on psychological reality are largely to be understoods as attempts to defend the boas position ) . in any case , it should be clear that the issue was never how many words a language might have for specific kinds of anything , but whether it has words for the general types or kinds . and in this context the only question is whether the eskimo languages have one word for \\'s now \\' like english or two like ancient greek or whether they only have a variety of more particular words for kinds of snow . alexis\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: english snow words\\n\\njonathan david bobaljik posted a message to vol . 5-1276 of this list in which he discusses the various yup \\' ik words for snow that have been contributed by anthony woodbury . for the sake of comparison he has a list of 9 or 10 english words for snow and snow-like things . i thought it would be useful to find out whether each of these english words means _ primarily _ snow or whether the snow sense is derived , figurative , or otherwise secondary . i have consulted the various editions of the oxford english dictionary . my results are as follows : a . acceptable cases : 1 . snow : a good english word with a respectable pedigree . means primarily snow . 2 . sleet : also good . by the way , is there an eskimo term corresponding to this ? 3 . slush : also good . 4 . avalanche : this word seems to have referred to snow avalanches from the beginning . 5 . blizzard : the first edition of the oed says , \" a modern word . . . . as applied to a \\'s now-squall , \\' the word became general in the american newspapers during the severe winter of 1880-81 ; but according to the _ milwaukee republican _ = ff 4 march 1881 , it had been so applied in the _ northern vindicator _ ( esthersville , iowa ) between 1860 and 1870 . it was apparently in colloquial use in the west much earlier . . . \" the latest edition of the oed has a citation from 1859 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * b . doubtful cases : 1 . cornice : this is really an architectural term , meaning the \" crown \" on a building . its use to refer to a type of snow formation is merely figurative . 2 . firn : this is certainly a very rare and specialized word . the oed marks it \" not naturalized \" ; its synonym _ n \\' ev \\' e _ is marked the same way . i would accept neither . 3 . drift : with the meaning \\'s now-drift \\' this word is attested c . 1300 , ( \" this castel . . quitter es pan snau drif [ t ] . \" ) but it clearly has too many other related senses , such as \" off-course movement of a boat \" and \" gist of what someone is saying . \" drift is related to \" to drive \" . compare bobaljik \\'s discussion of yup \\' ik _ natquik _ \\'d rifting snow \\' . 4 . flurry : this word means primarily \\' gust \\' or \\'s quall \\' . washington irving is cited in 1836 talking about \" flurries of snow \" , but there are other cases of flurries of rain , birds . conclusion : not primarily a snow word . 5 . sinkhole : bobaljik rejects _ muruaneq _ \\'s oft , deep snow \\' , offering \" sinkhole \" as roughly comparable ( and presumably also unacceptable ) . = 20 \" sinkhole \" is not in the oed . my understanding of a sinkhole is any depression in which liquid collects , especially in the ground . i do not think it has anything to do with snow per se . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * c . special case : 1 . frost : i have left \" frost \" out of the english list , since it has more to do with frozen dew and ice than with snow . i have also omitted \" rime \" and \" hoarfrost \" ( \" hoar \" is figurative for old age ) . accordingly , i urge that words for frost be omitted from the eskimo lists . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * d . conclusion : my count is 5 good english words whose primary meanings are snow or forms of snow . bobaljik also allows only 5 \" exclusively snow-related simple roots \" in yup \\' ik ( excluding \" frost \" as explained above ) . i am not a specialist in english etymology , but i am experienced at using the oed . is _ muruaneq _ \\'s oft , deep snow \\' really not a purely snow word , as bobaljik says ? i would also like to know what \" eskimo \" languages there are other than yup \\' ik for which snow-words are recorded in detail . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 = 09 = 09 = 09 = 09 < charmii @ u . washington . edu >\\n',\n",

philosophical preprint exchange \\'s collection , including the abstracts and tables of contents of an increasing number of philosophical journals , is now available via mosaic and the world wide web . our www server is still under development and is changing rapidly , and at the moment there are still several rough spots , but access to all the ippe materials is in place . due to the rich interface provided by the web , browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe \\'s structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last \" news from the ippe \" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of \" minimal refereeing \" by the ippe \\'s international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe \\'s large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same \" minimal refereeing \" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october \\'s joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe \\'s board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange \\'s ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy

       " 'Subject: sum : native speaker intuitions\\n\\nseveral weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of \" native speaker intutions \" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach \" modern english grammar , \" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , \" john asked mary to leave , \" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like \" john asked to leave , \" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do \" generative \" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , \" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . \\' john asked mary to leave , \\' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) \" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as \" john asked mary to leave \" as meaning \" john asked mary \\'s permission to leave \" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that \" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we \\' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . \" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in \" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , \" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that \" we \\' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . \" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room .

( the sanskrit case quite obviously did not fit ) o . k . , i put it in a provokative fashion , formulated more sharply than i really had it in mind . the reactions were vivid . the case of india ( sanskrit ) : it was pointed out that in the sanskrit case the concern was to preserve the \" correct \" language which was in danger of beeing lost otherwise which would have made religious texts unreadable . ( michael newman , karl v . teeter , mechthild reh , european cases : generally , the intention was more the emancipation from latin and / or to give the own country a status as respectable as the roman empire .

( michael newman ) nynorsk : the rise and conception of nynorsk ( landsmaal ) in norway in the 1800s was part of the nationalist reaction to danish rule ( imperialism ) . that \\'s a long story , but nynorsk never succeeded in dominating norway , i \\' m afraid .

( michael newman ) are linguists imperialists ? several people asked wheather i was thinking in that direction . i certainly do n\\'t ! ! linguistics can help to answer lots of questions ( see the greek sophistic tradition ) . the question was more to what made any linguistic attempt suddenly beeing successful on a national level . thus , my idea refers more to linguistics beeing ( mis ) used than beeing evil .

       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis ,\\n\\nit may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in \" out \" , \" house \" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in \" oat \" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in \" right \" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between \" writer \" and \" rider \" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in \" eight \" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that \" sorry \" rhymes with \" story \" . this is rare for the words \" sorry \" , \" sorrow \" , \" borrow \" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for \" forest \" , \" orange \" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that \\'s enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n\\'t want to make anything out of the fact that he \\'s american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n\\'t hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t \\'s , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .\\n',\n",

( \" ) . re-editing , adding and deleting labels labels can be re-edited , new labels can be added anywhere in the signal , and labels can be deleted individually or for an entire signal . reproduce labeled segment while the label is open for editing , you can play the selected portion of the signal by doing command - y . if you \\' re labeling a selection , and if you \\' ve set the audio to play signal selections , you \\' ll hear the segment which you \\' re about to label . align labels you can choose any of nine different vertical positions for placing labels . when you close a label with a click in the close rectangle or with return , the label automatically \" snaps \" to the nearest standard position . save labels the label information is saved as a tab - delimited text file with the extension \" . lbl \" . it is stored in the same folder as the signal file . label format the label format is in the public domain and is fully documented . it is available on the signalyze servers ( see below ) . transparent saving and opening open file operations on signal files that have accompanying \" . lbl \" text files cause the label information to be read into signalyze . save file operations on signals with labeling information automatically saves the labels in the same folder as the signal . save file operations for signals without labeling information erases whatever label file may have existed in the folder . label in phonetics you can use any phonetic or normal font in the labels . however for phonetics , it is recommended stick to sigpalfont ( the shareware font supplied with signalyze ) . sigpalfont preserves the numbers and angular brackets you need to indicate labeling levels , which is usually not possible with other phonetic fonts . search by label or by level you can search for labels using either a given labeling level or the label \\'s name . you can specify two separate search patterns . switch between the two patterns with the shift-lock key . more info and demo information on signalyze version 3 . 0 is available as follows : by ftp : ftp macfl4082 . unil . ch or ftp 130 . 223 . 104 . 31 login anonymous by gopher server : name of machine : gopher . unil . ch , find \" europe \" and \" switzerland \" , select \" university of lausanne \" , select \" autres gophers de l3unil \" , select \" faculte des lettres \" , select \" laboratoire d3analyse informatique de la parole ( laip ) \" , select \" speech analysis and speech synthesis \" , select \" signalyze \" prof . eric keller ( new email address : eric . keller @ imm . unil . ch ) laboratoire d \\' analyse / / ^ | | | | = = \\\\ \\\\ informatique de la parole ( laip ) / / / \\\\ | | | | | | lettres , universite de lausanne / / / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | = = / / ch-1015 lausanne , switzerland / / / / = = = \\\\ \\\\ | | | | fax + 41 21 6924639 / + 41 21 692 4510 / / = = = = / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | \" . 6 . ucla - uppsala analysis package ( to run on macrecorder files ) \" write to : software manager , phonetics lab , linguistics dept , ucla , los angeles , ca 90024-1543 for our order form . it \\'s $ 5 for just this disk . \" ( peter ladefoged ) 7 . gw instruments soundscope ( formerly macspeechlab ii ) ( mac ) \" more able to be tailored to individual uses than csl , but also a little clumsier and slower than csl . i think it runs about $ 3000 . \" ( alex francis ) c ) for unix 1 . xwaves + it costs around $ 5000 and the manufacturer is : \" entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) 2 . dsp ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 3 . sfs ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 4 . digital ears no more information , only the name of the manufacturer , i . e . metaresearch 5 . ogi speech \" this is free ! ! ! i have never used it professionally , but while working at los alamos nat \\' l . labs i did get a chance to play with it . it comes with a good manual , and works with a number of different sound-file types , and can be configured for a number of different platforms ( sun & sgi ) . . . . it needs some additional hardware . \" ( alex francis ) . 6 . entropic sps software that runs through the xwaves + package . i do not know its prise ; also , i did not understand if it is a latest software improvement of xwaves + . \" address : entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) additional information : read , buder & kent .

       " 'Subject: snow 3 1 / 2\\n\\ndear linguists , i \\' ve been following the discussion about snowy words here and elsewhere for some time now , and i can\\'t but disagree with douglas j . glick ( see vol-5 - 1322 ) in two points . for one , i do n\\'t find the discussion \" relatively uninteresting \" . it is interesting indeed to see what kind of ideas about the issue as such and linguistics in general tonguesters ( or is l . more p . c . ? : - ) put forward . it so happened that i encountered this nice passage in a book i bought a few days ago : whereas english [ . . . ] has only one word for _ snow _ ( or two if we include _ sleet _ ) , eskimo has several . trudgill ( 1974 ) : 27 this is a book written for the general audience , by a native speaker of english , who \" has been a lecturer in the department of linguistic science at the university of reading since 1970 \" ( op . cit . ) , and it is twenty years old . but you sometimes still hear assertions like the above , and i know the same thing from german speakers . still , in german we have at least schnee , schnee ( - mann , - regen , matsch ) , ( schnee ) flocke , neuschnee , harsch , waechte , lawine , loipe , hagel , graupel , and for english , snow , snow ( bank , fort , house , man , - mixed-with - rain , - flake , - storm ) , slush ( snow ) , ( snow ) cornice , avalanche , blizzard , dusting , flurry , frost , hail , hardpack , igloo , pingo , powder , sleet . in these lists , i \\' m including some at least seemingly semantically transparent compounds like neuschnee ( ` new + snow \\' ) , schneeregen snow + rain \\' ) and so on , as well as some words that are only frosty and not very snowy , as well as some that have only to do with snow and nothing else . in a serious collection , the data should be much richer , in order to have a borderline between good and bad examples fall well within the field , allow an assessment of the fuzzyness of this line , and , perhaps , discover some model for the cognitive structure of the words in question . ( the data for the english list is , apart from some editing , taken from tony woodbury \\'s posting ( see vol-5 - 1239 ) ) . granted not everything white in the listings given is snow , how can we comment on the quotation above ? at least , the writer should have told the reader why so many snowy words of english do not count as snow , or , perhaps , that eskimo in his opinion has no cover term , where english does have one . as it stands , however , it should make everybody very cautious about obtaining data of any language - - - including , obviously , their own - - - by way of secondary sources . likewise , how much do the manymany ` facts \\' drawn from ` exotic \\' ( i . e . , not very well documented ) languages count , which , for example , phonologists like to decorate their elaborate articles with ? two , i do n\\'t really get the point in excluding words like cornice from a snowy list . now if there are people out there who use the word primarily to denote some sort of snow formation and feel the word is in its * architectural * meaning of rather metaphorical nature , what \\'s the point in telling them they \\' re ` really \\' wrong ? in german , waechte , flocke and harsch might very well be derived from some other morphemes . in fact , this only tells us eskimo is not very well documented . i guess a lot of those words the hoax claims as semantically primitive would turn out much more connected to the rest of the vocabulary had we only the relative wealth of historical data we have for the indoeuropean languages . back to german again , flocke to me primarily denotes not ` something flaky \\' but rather precisely ` a snowflake \\' , and all other usages seem to be derived from that . harsch seems to be connected with harsch ` harsh \\' ; but used as a noun , what other denotation but that kind of slighly melted and frozen snow does it have ? loipe is the kind of tracks skiers use in their discipline and , i guess , not a ` very german \\' word - - - but disregarding borrowed words is just as silly as looking down on adopted children . anyway , there seems to be a need for that word . it \\'s snowy , very specialized , and , for my feeling , totally unconnected with any other word in german . of course i might be totally wrong ( and loipe is derived from ( ski ) laufen ` to run ( to ski ) \\' ) . now there \\'s the point . linguists are looking , on the one hand , into history to find out what really happened and try to extrapolate people \\'s minds to describe what \\'s really going on . if there \\'s someone with a lot of waechten and cornices and flakes on his mind , but with no connection to other non-snowy words for him , this is a fact of that ideolect . of course , as soon some linguist comes along and tells him the historical truth , behaviour and concepts of the speaker might change . . . even if in fact it was some sort of folk-etymology he absorbed when listening to the linguist : - ) . folk - etymology is there because it is a way we can imagine things to be . . . so , what layer of this person \\'s brain is it that synchronic word counting is claiming to acount for , and how historical a derivation is allowed or necessary in historical linguistics ? finally , i would like to point out that apart from some pretty specialized words having to do woth snow , rain is another phenomenon languages may have more or less to say about . in german , for example , you have niesel and nieselregen , denoting a very light rain or spray . there seem to be no other uses or compounds for this word apart from es nieselt , however , and no immediately related , more basic word niesel could be said to be derived from . so , we have wasser , regen , niesel , and more . eskimo does n\\'t appear that much outlandish any more , does it ? quotation taken from : trudgill , peter : _ sociolinguistics : an introduction _ . penguin books . 1974 wolfgang lipp castor @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de i52023 @ sakura . kudpc . kyoto-u . ac . jp\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: comparative method in syntax\\n\\nfritz newmeyer asks if it is legitimate to apply the comparative method in syntax . my answer is yes , but it is more difficult . the main reason why one sees more work on historical-comparative syntax than fifty years ago is that syntax has become much more prestigious in recent decades . i do n\\'t think that there was a shift from a once \" standard \" view that syntactic reconstruction is impossible . bernhard delbrueck \\'s historical-comparative syntax of indo - european , published a hundred years ago , clearly showed that comparative syntax is both possible and fruitful , but perhaps too difficult to attract many followers . the view that historical-comparative syntax is impossible was defended in some detail in lightfoot \\'s ( 1979 ) principles of diachronic syntax , but few researchers seem to have been discouraged by lightfoot \\'s attitude . it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is always imperfect , but that is no reason not to attempt reconstruction . the main error on lightfoot \\'s side is that there is no syntactic analog to the regularity of sound change . it \\'s just a bit more complicated in syntax - - just like syntax is more complicated overall than phonology . basically , the analog to phonemes and words are words and sentences . true , the difference between words and sentences is that in general sentences are not stored in the lexicon . but neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , but nobody seems ever to have objected to morphological reconstruction ) , and some sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs and idioms , which often show syntactic archaisms . and since earlier syntax often survives in \" fossilized \" form in later morphology , we have another rich source of data for diachronic syntax . in addition to regularity of change , we need general principles of change for plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles that predict likely changes like assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . in syntax , similar principles of change exist as well : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense and aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . all these processes ( instances of grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes and provide safe guides for linguists seeking to make sense of daughter language diversity by reconstructing a proto-syntax . the massive regularities of grammaticalization are generally ignored in generative studies of syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues that there are no genuine principles of diachronic syntax ) , but if one takes them into account , they help in the difficult task of reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )\\n',\n",
       " \"Subject: re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?\\n\\ntheoretically , there is no reason why the comparative method could not be applied to syntactic properties . however , there are two practical , very great , impediments : 1 . syntax dealing with word order , what is word order ? and further which word order in which environments ? e . g . : ich verstehe sie . ploetzlich verstehe ich sie .

       " \"Subject: basic word order\\n\\nthis is a somewhat delayed reaction to frederick newmeyer 's posting on basic word order . i was prepared to let someone else comment on the underlying logic of newmeyer 's message . this did not happen , however , so here comes . newmeyer observes that data from a given language seldom exhibits an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criteria to resolve this ambiguity . he further notes that this fact reveals a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite terms , ' presents a challenge to it ' ) . he adds , on two occasions , that generative linguistics is increasingly coming to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some applications of the principles-and - parameters approach are taking both language-particular and cross-linguistic data into account more seriously than used to be the case . before these developments , generative linguistics decreed that every ( configurational ) language has some sort of basic word order , as specified by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seems to suggest that this type of basic word order did not share the weakness that is ' increasingly ' becoming a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conceptions of basic word order , resides in the fact that the former did not , whereas the latter does , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data . newmeyer 's formulation then seems to suggest that not paying attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data is a strength of the theory . esa itkonen\\n\",\n",

       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics\\n\\nkarl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is \" novel \" , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in \" their \" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a \" crazy \" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say \\' lexical items \\' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .\\n',\n",
       " \"Subject: comparative method ( shared sound changes )\\n\\nalice faber 's very sound posting brings up a very important point : indvidual sound changes , especially those which are known to be common in languages of the world , cannot be the basis of subclassification . what you need is either sets of unrelated changes ( english has diphthongized some of the same long high vowels as high german , so that eis and ice , haus and house sound rather similar , but they do not share other changes ) , or a chronology of the sound changes with respect to other changes ( e . g . , the diphthongization in english was presumably preceded by the loss of / x / or / c , / , but there is no such change in high german ) . on the other hand , we find that the northern uto - aztecan languages share the changes of intervocalic / l / - ) / n / , / n / - > velar nasal , and / c / - > / y / . any one of these would mean little , but all three together ( and the fact that the / l / - ) / n / does not feed the / n / - > / ng / change ) make it reasonably certain that these really are shared innovations , and that northern uto - aztecan is a genuine classificatory unit ( a valid node in the uto - aztecan tree , if you will ) - - something that has until recently been generally doubted .\\n\",\n",

       " 'Subject: books and articles on cd-rom\\n\\nthis text is also available in german ( see below ) dear linguist readers throughout the last years the working conditions of many scientists have been profoundly changed through the introduction of modern data processing technology . almost every workplace is being equipped with a computer which , after hours or even days of patiently getting acquainted with the working procedure of these tools , constitutes an enormous advantage . this advantage especially shows in the ever more efficient saving , processing , and transferring of data . thus , as early as today , most of the manuscripts of books , articles , diplomas , and master \\'s theses are being processed through word processing programmes and are eventually available as a computer file . besides word processing , both newer , more rapid processors and more efficient programmes also make possible an ever higher integration of images , image sequences and sound recordings into a written text . accordingly , a phonetic transcription of an experiment can contain , in addition to the text , not only a recording of the language but also photographs of the articulating organs , such as mouth and upper jaw . that allows the experiment to be followed much more easily and also to be conducted by other scientists from a different view point . in addition to saving how the research work is done , it is also possible to save the subject of the research on any kind of storage media . in order to archive the amount of data resulting from this particular combination of text , sound and images , the compact disc ( cd ) has come more and more into fashion as the perfect storage medium . today , many publications are already available on cd . besides the possibility of a multi-media presentation of knowledge , the cd has one more advantage : because of the low production costs of a cd and its huge storage capacity , more publications of scientists can be made available than is currently possible in journals and books . at this point , the possibility emerges for young scientists as well as for renowned ones to publish their works that have up to now tended to disappear in some drawer because of either the publishing costs or a \" not-a - chance \" notion . with this as a background , i would like to begin a survey to determine to what extent the linguists of all fields might have interest in the following questions : 1 . ) is multi-media technology commonly accepted ? do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year \\'s young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit \\' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd \\'s gesammelt ?

       " 'Subject: aaai fall symoposium on formalizing context\\n\\nformalizing context aaai-95 fall symposium mit , cambridge , massachusetts november 10-12 , 1995 call for papers description the notion of context has played an important role in ai systems for many years . however , formal logical explication of contexts remains an area of research in which there are significant open issues . this symposium will provide a forum for discussing formalizations of contexts , approaches to resolving open issues , and application areas for context formalisms . the most ambitious goal of formalizing contexts is to make automated reasoning systems which are never permanently stuck with the concepts they use at a given time because they can always transcend the context they are in . such a capability would allow the designer of a reasoning system to include only such phenomena as are required for the system \\'s immediate purpose , retaining the assurance that if a broader system is required later , \" lifting rules \" can be devised to restate the facts from the narrow context in the broader context with qualifications added as necessary . a formal theory of context in which sentences are always considered as asserted within a context could provide a basis for such transcendence . formal theories of context are also needed to provide a representation of the context associated with a particular circumstance , e . g . the context of a conversation in which terms have particular meanings that they would n\\'t have in the language in general . linguists and philosophers have already studied similar notions of context . an example is the situation theory that has been proposed in philosophy and applied to linguistics . however , these theories usually lie embedded in the analysis of specific linguistic constructions , so locating the exact match with ai concerns is itself a research challenge . this symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied or applied contexts in ai or related fields . technical papers dealing with formalizations of context , the problem of generality , and use of context in common sense reasoning are especially welcome . however , survey papers which focus on contexts from other points of view , such as philosophy , linguistics , or natural language processing , or which apply contexts in other areas of ai , are also encouraged . submission information persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers ( up to 12 pages , 12pt font ) . persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1 - 2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications . a postscript file or 8 paper copies should be sent to the program chair . limited funding will be available to support student travel . timetable april 14 , 1995 submission deadline . may 19 , 1995 submitters will be informed of decisions august 15 , 1995 final papers due september 20 , 1995 aaai will mail working notes to the participants november 10-12 , 1995 fall symposium program committee sasa buvac ( chair ) . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . buvac @ sail . stanford . edu richard fikes . knowledge systems laboratory , stanford university , 701 welch road , bldg . c , palo alto , ca 94304 . fikes @ ksl . stanford . edu ramanathan guha . mcc , 3500 , w . balcones center drive , austin , tx 78759 . guha @ mcc . com pat hayes . beckman institute , 405 north mathews av . , urbana , il 61801 . phayes @ cs . uiuc . edu john mccarthy . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . jmc @ sail . stanford . edu murray shanahan . imperial college , dept of computing , 180 queen \\'s gate , london sw7 2bz , england . mps @ doc . ic . ac . uk robert stalnaker . 20d-220 , department of linguistics and philosophy , m . i . t . cambridge , ma 02139 . stal @ mit . edu johan van benthem . institute for logic , language and computation , university of amsterdam , plantage muidergracht 24 , 1018 tv amsterdam , the netherlands . johan @ fwi . uva . nl ( postscript and plain text versions of this announcement are available through the symposium www page at http : / / sail . stanford . edu / buvac / 95 - context-symposium and via anonymous ftp from sail . stanford . edu in the directory / buvac / 95 - context-symposium . )\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: query : pseudo - explanations\\n\\ni am trying to collect examples of pseudo-explanations of linguistic phenomena which invoke supposed beliefs or customs such as the following : ( a ) hopi pluralizes the word for \\' cloud \\' the way that it usually pluralizes only animate nouns , so whorf claimed that this proves that the hopis believe clouds to be alive , ( b ) malagasy and some other languages tend to use passive rather than active voice forms in imperatives , so it is has often been claimed ( i even did this myself once ) that this is a matter of politeness , because by using a passive you are avoiding actually ordering the addressing around , while still making it clear what you want done . ( c ) one of the languages of the torres straits uses the dual in speaking to a married woman , and this was explained by saying that a married woman was assumed to have a child with her ! ! ! ( d ) there is even the famous case of a russian work which claimed that the adjective * beremennyj * \\' pregnant \\' had no masculine forms ( like the one i just cited ) because only females can get pregnant and then used this very form , saying that a \" beremennyj muzhchina \" ( = \" pregnant - masc man \" ) is inconceivable ! these are the kinds of things i would like to collect . and it would be especially if there were a case where the explanation was valid and not pseudo , of course , please send the examples to me and i will post a summary .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1433 comparative method\\n\\ni re-read newmeyer \\'s original posting ( date 30 nov 94 ) and noticed that it has an implicit attack on the notion of \" basic word order \" for comparative purposes . this flows from his earlier question on how basic word order is variously defined by various analysts , implying that it lacks precision . to the extent that i have understood the responses so far , no one has responded to this particular point , so here goes - - basically in agreement with newmeyer , but with some criticism of the assumed larger implications for comparative reconstruction of syntax . i \\' ll stick to what i know about linguistic events in europe since i expect the events to be more familiar to most readers than events in other language families , so that my examples may speak to readers \\' previous ideas about particular linguistic events referred to below , and , under the best circumstances , provoke further discussion . to anticipate , the notion of basic word order is too simple-minded ( simplistic ? ) for diachronic purposes . fn : \" could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? \" bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j \\' ai rien fait etc . are n\\'t they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of \" basic \" word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose \" basic \" means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can\\'t be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : \" should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? \" bw : newmeyer \\'s reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that \" basic \" word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if \" basic \" word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct \" proto-basic \" word orders , such that \" minor \" word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as \" proto-minor \" word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n\\'t work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as \" basic \" and \" minor \" for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in \" basic \" word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of \" basic \" word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing \" basic \" word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the \" basic \" word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n\\'t need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : \" i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : \" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . \" \" bw : [ why with \" increasing frequency \" ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in \" what / hullo , are you kidding me ? \" ( such a marker \" ibai \" is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has \" me : \" ) . do n\\'t get me wrong . i \\' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i \\' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it \\'s variable in gothic where it \\'s variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as \" evolution of the idiolect \" is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic \" basic \" word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if \" basic \" only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a \" minor \" postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i \\' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of \" languages \" in the world all together . however , this is n\\'t really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i \\' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing \" accusative \" definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and \" ergative \" definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : \" and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . \" bw : i think the thrust of fn \\'s suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably \" unlikely or impossible \" , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think \" unlikely \" is more accurate than \" impossible \" depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov \\'s new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels \" cataclysmic \" syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn \\'s suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson \\'s caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it \\'s ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former \\'s preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are \" basically \" the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji\\n',\n",

       " \"Subject: comparative syntax\\n\\nwhile i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?\\n\",\n",

       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1414 native speaker intuitions\\n\\ni would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva \\'s questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the \" unmarked \" case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of \\' ask \\' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation \" going to the bathroom \" . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it \\'s implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of \" role identity \" , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( \" a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german \" ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as \" pragmatic roles \" . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an \" implicit controller \" , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book \" kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive \" published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker \\'s intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany\\n',\n",

to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german \" pfennig \" comes from an earlier germanic form with initial \" p \" that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say \" penny \" ; if the form turned out to be \" twenny \" i would be in trouble ; given german \" pfund \" i am committed to something like \" pund \" in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of \" pound \" is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n\\'t nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if \" pound \" was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if \" penny \" was shown to be borrowed from italian \" penne \" during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i \\' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg \\'s muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: comparative method\\n\\nin response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and \" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world \" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this \" because the cut-off point is so shallow \" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet \\'s position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that \\'s how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: typology of historical change\\n\\ntypology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning \" water falls \" could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for \" rain \" . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are \" possible \" semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring \" distance \" of semantic shift and \" distance \" of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what \" comparable \" means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the \" semantic distance \" along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated \" distance \" counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated \" distance \" counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the \" phonetic distance \" along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of \" closeness \" of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . \" the comparative method \" currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term \" the comparative method \" , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word \" the \" were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term \" comparative methods \" . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: sum : vowel length in orthographies\\n\\na few weeks ago i posted a query about the orthographic marking of vowel length , with special reference to korean . i received many very interesting replies , both on korean and on the general question , which i will summarise below - the whole topic raises some issues that people might like to comment further on . first though - thanks to everyone who took the trouble to send me information . it was my first linglist query and i \\' m delighted with the way it works ! it would have taken me ages to assemble all these examples from library research . at first i was surprised to get a lot of replies suggesting as examples of languages that dont mark vowel length , english , german and so on . then i realised i should have been clearer in my original request . a . fox put the problem well with his question : \\' your query about writing and vowel length is slightly odd , since it implies that in most languages with contrastive vowel-length the writing system represents it . but this depends on what you mean by \\' representing \\' vowel-length ; in the sense of having an explicit and consistent marker of length , such as a double letter , a diacritic or other length mark , this is not very common , at least in languages with which i am familiar . but length can be implicitly marked in a variety of ways , and therefore discoverable from the spelling for anyone ( such as the literate native speaker ) who knows the system . \\' i \\'d intended to include all of these things as ways of \\' representing \\' vowel length ; definitely not only cases where vowel length is represented as a feature in its own right by a macron , double symbol etc . so what i wanted was examples of languages with an extensive system of minimal pairs differentiated wholly or mainly by vowel length which have identical orthographic representations of the members of the pairs . this is the situation in korean , for quite a largish set of words of both one and two syllables . it \\'s definitely not the situation in english , german , canadian french , danish etc . i dont think its the situation in latin either , though i might be wrong , and would be glad of correction . here and in quite a few of the other languages that were suggested to me , vowel length is predictable from some other aspect of the word ( including its lexical identity ) so you dont actually get many or any minimal pairs differentiated only by length . right ? the same would appear to be the case for hausa ; and possibly for the other estonian vowel length contrast ? my estonian is a bit rusty , but would i be right in guessing that the full three way contrast is fairly limited ? however , several of the pacific languages that were mentioned to me do seem to fit the bill : tokelauan , samoan , maori , fijian and the ponapeic languages are all candidates for having what i would call a genuine length contrast ( although it seems that in maori at any rate the system of contrasts is quite limited ) , which is at least sometimes not shown in the orthography . so , it seems , does the australian language bardi , and its orthography doesnt show it . . the thing i found very interesting was the number of people who sent anecdotal evidence about how native speakers of these languages feel about marking vowel length . their writing systems are all of course relatively recent introductions based on the roman alphabet , and there are plenty of ways they could show vowel length . but they dont always use this potential it seems . apparently the speakers of ponapeic languages use length marking inconsistently , so do fijian speakers , maori speakers find it \\' unnatural \\' and dont like using it , tokelauan teachers have decided not to teach it , and in samoa use of a length marker is banned ! there seems to be something worth exploring here . the obvious hypothesis is that though the words are differentiated phonetically by length , this is not the distinction that is most salient to the native speakers . the next obvious hypothesis is that it is some kind of lexical distinction , similar to that of english \\' good \\' vs \\' food \\' , \\' boot \\' vs \\'s oot \\' , \\' look \\' vs \\' loop \\' etc that is perfectly simple for native speakers and horrible for learners . ( which could also explain why gaelic has taken the opposite trend and started marking vowel length where it never used to , since it is used so much nowadays by less than fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts on these hypotheses would be gratefully received . but back to korean . . . this still seems like a very unusual situation to me . it seems likely and indeed it was suggested by some of the korean respondents that the original hangul did have a length marker , but i have found no evidence for this in my research on hangul . ( that \\'s why i posted the orginal query , and i ve just had another look at ledyard \\'s thesis on the topic . ) maybe i just need to do more careful research : pointers on this also gratefully received . a couple of points of clarification : the distinction between the monosyllabic vowel length \\' minimal pairs \\' does seem to be dying out ( though it is the fact that it previously existed but was not marked in the writing system at that time that i find odd ; could it be that the lack of orthographic representation contributes to its demise ? ? ) . but there is a clear distinction in the sound of the two syllable pairs . to my ears these distinction seems to be much more one of pitch accent than of length . and : when i said that native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , i didnt mean that they say \\' my language doesnt have a vowel length distinction \\' - which would indeed be a statement to be cautious of ! i meant they dont know which word is supposed to have the long vowel and which the short . this is consistent with information sent by native speakers that it is something taught in schools as a prescriptive rule well for anyone who has read this far , let me reward you by sharing with you this response from fran karttunen ( i hope she doesnt mind ) . i dont know exactly how to interpret it with respect to my questions above , but i \\' m sure there \\'s something in it for all of us ! \\' both the maya and the nahua ( speakers of unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved a partially-syllabic approach to writing before the arrival of europeans in the first quarter of the 16th century . from what we can tell of their writing , both made some use of rhebus principles in which a drawing of thing , the name of which was similar rather than identical , was used to suggest the intended word / syllable . for instance , a drawing of a a bare bottom ( tzin-tli \" buttocks \" ) was used for the honorific suffix - tzin . likewise a drawing of a banner , pan-tli was used for locative - pan . these two examples are suffixes , but there are similar cases for initial syllables of nahuatl noun stems , for instance . vowel length , at least for nahuatl , is not taken into account in these cases . the honorific suffix today has the reflex of a long vowel in most modern dialects of nahuatl , making it homophonous with the stem of \" buttocks \" , but attestation from the sixteenth century consistently show them to contrast in vowel length ( short for the honorific , long for \" buttocks \" ) . same for \" banner \" ( long vowel ) versus the locative ( short ) . \\' thanks again to all respondents , who are listed below as acknowledgment .

       " 'Subject: comparative method\\n\\nthese are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser \\'s message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally \\'s general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer \\'s statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer \\'s ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer \\'s second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the \" true \" or \" real \" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter \\'s recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer \\'s point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : \" since it is clear that everybody \\'s first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . \" ( please note the words \" first approximation \" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : \" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . \" ( please note the words \" the only way \" and \" establish \" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter \\'s criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) \" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies \" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the \" real work \" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving \" nothing at all \" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is \" real work \" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally \" the real work \" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser \\'s message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser \\'s mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser \\'s paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser \\'s message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg \\'s errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg \\'s method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg \\'s methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are \" obviously \" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article \" common pathways of illumination \" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) \" chance lookalikes \" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of \" chance lookalikes \" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of \" substrate \" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg \\'s errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg \\'s original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether \" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . \" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser \\'s assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser \\'s supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg \\'s hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser \\'s conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as \" the \" ( read \" the only \" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg \\'s data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the \" holy \" and the \" unclean \" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser \\'s discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be \" necessary to exclude chance \" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of \" the comparative method \" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso \\'s contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled \" typology of historical change \" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard \\'s nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp\\n\\ncall for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today \\'s text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is \" context of the previous utterance / sentence \" \" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far \" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in \" official \" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : -

       " 'Subject: rate of loss for \" basic \" vocabulary\\n\\nsome months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n\\'t have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt \\'s data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt \\'s or guy \\'s assumption that the \" prolem \" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: re : 5 . 1462 comparative method\\n\\na couple of remarks on recent exchange on comparative method : 1 ) as far as importance of morphology is concerned i believe that alexis is right ( sorry , karl ! ) . it is important , but i think that it would be impossible to insist that only morphological prallels like latin est , sunt and german ist , sind cited by karl teeter can prove relationship . old church slavic has the parallel forms iest # and so ~ t # , perfectly agreeing with karl teeter \\'s latin and german . however , in modern russian the present of copula dissapeared ( we can still recognize forms like iest \\' and sut \\' , but they sound bitterly archaic ) : on student ( he [ is ] student ) , oni studenty ( they [ are ] stu - dents ) . let us imagine the situation when the only surviving slavic language is russian and we just do not have old church slavonic materials . does the lack of the paradigm make russian less \" indoeuropean \" than latin or german , or does it make impossible the proof of its ie nature ? i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won\\'t be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi \\' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like \" proto _ english - french \" can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as \" semantic primitive \" . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of \" mass comparisons \" is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg \\'s \" mass comparisons \" . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol \\'s kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych \\'s proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych \\'s work is like greenberg \\'s or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: comparative method\\n\\njust as morris halle once pointed out that any phonological system could be analyzed as having two phonemes , so too it seems clear that any two languages , related or not , could have a reconstruction done for them , involving both a set of correspondences among the words or morphemes and a comparative grammar . and just as in fact a phonology with only two phonemes would be just a formal excersise and not a real phonology , so too the \" reconstruction \" i am referring to would have no validity unless the languages really are related ( or in the case of mixed languages , unless the relevant parts were related ) . but the formal possibility is important to the following extent : it shows that we cannot assume that the ability to write a comparative grammar is either necessary or sufficient for showing that the languages in question are related . it is the ability to write a convincing comparative gramm ` r that is significant here , but by the same token language relatedness can be sjown by establishing a convincing set of correspodences between suitable sets of words or morphemes of the languages being compared . i will even conceded that it is harder , in general , to be convincing in the case of a comparative grammar than it is in the case of a set of correspondences ( since the former would seem to include the latter plus a lot more ) . but what no one has yet shown here or anywhere else is that the only way to establish language relatedness is by writing a complete comparative grammar , and even meillet conceded by 1925 that you cannot even demand a fragment of a grammar because there are perfectly well-established families where this either has not been or indeed cannot be done . it is another matter 9and ultimately a more interesting one ) that significant amount of grammatical comparison ( though not a whole grammar ) has been offered for nostratic ( a theory i find likely though perhaps not yet established ) as well as for amerind ( a theory which i find basically as unsupported as do karl and victor , for example ) . and it is perhaps not uninteresting that illich - svitych proposed to write a nostratic comparative grammar but never did , much as sapirpromised to write one for uto - aztecan but failed to ( though we should in all fairness note that sapir lived for another two decades , whereas illich - svitych died without even finishing the lexical and morphemic comparisons which are the bulk of the evidence that we have in the public domain for nostratic ) . this is no criticism of sapir , of course , if we agree that there was no need to write a comparatve grammar of uto - aztecan in order for everybody to be able to see that the uto - aztecan languages are related . just as there is no need for this in the case of nostratic 9and indeed given the age of proto - nostratic , if there was such a language , it seems unlkikely that we will ever have more than a very partial grammar\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: \" syntax and the comparative method\\n\\nconcerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i \\' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the \\'d aughter \\' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative \\' mother \\' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling \\'s book : man \\'s many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world \\'s population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous \\' sprachbunds \\' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n\\'t even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are \\' related \\' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n\\'t be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek \\' colonies \\' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain \\' areal \\' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can\\'t really speak of the \\' oddity \\' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means \\' odd \\' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia \\' langauges \\' , would n\\'t we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n\\'t vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the \\' parent \\' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can \\' prove \\' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the \\' unlikely \\' correspondences ( i . e . \\' ist / sind \\' and \\' est / sunt \\' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany\\n',\n",

turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means \" people \" ( or \" ordinary people \" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves \" jieng \\' \" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled \" jiye \" ) is the same word , but i have n\\'t checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term \" the masses \" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let \\'s see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n\\'t need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n\\'t have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the \" h \" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with \" tense \" and \" lax \" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang \\' we : hn ang \\' wehnoh ang \\' wen ng \\' wan ng \\' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in \\' 5 \\' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka \\' 1 \\' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka \\' 10 \\' ( cf . dinka - nuer \\' 5 \\' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic \\' 4 - 5 \\' or slavic \\' 9-10 \\' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n\\'t have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling \\' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern also \\' hal \\' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong \\' wahn -

( i have n\\'t loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n\\'t transposed the word for \\' 10 \\' with some other word like \\' toothbrush \\' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for \\' 10 \\' , but with doubts about whether karamojong \\' 5 \\' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for \\' 10 \\' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that \\'s why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof \\'s nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of \" hamitic \" in the older terminology ( \" afro - asiatic \" is g \\'s coinage for older \" semito - hamitic \" ) . . note nubian \\' 10 \\' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n\\'t help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian \\' 10 \\' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above - - and with good reason . . g , p106 again , compares bari \\' 10 \\' \" mere \" with khordofan nubian \" bure \" for the same ) . as central sudanic , lugbara might be expected by the naive to be even more different from nilotic than nubian , but the numbers do n\\'t show that . g uses lugbara \\' 2 \\' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka \\' 1 \\' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with \\' 10 \\' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for \" one \" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi \\' 1 \\' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i \\' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypotheses about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g \\'s mass comparison s , e . g . , the pan -

       " 'Subject: could of\\n\\ni have been following the recent discussion of ` would of \\' with interest , as i am writing my dissertation on the grammaticalization of ` wouldve \\' / ` couldve \\' / ` shouldve \\' ( i . e . modal + ` have \\' + pastparticiple constructions ) . [ for those unfamiliar with the term , grammaticalization is , approximately , a type of gradual reanalysis that turns material that used to be more independent and lexical into material that is more dependent and grammatical . ] i \\' ve noticed that the discussion has focused on pronunciation and spelling as indicators of \" native speaker intuitions . \" another approach is to look at syntax . many speakers consider what wouldve you done ? pretty close to acceptable ( though of course many other speakers completely reject this ) . then there are also sentences like ( both heard on npr in the past week ) they never asked the right questions when they shouldve have . ( orangecounty ) or if this incident had occurred a year ago , i wouldve had been more concerned about it . ( helicopter in n . korea ) for now i will make a couple of points of my own , and next time i will respond to some previous postings , esp . frits stuurman \\'s queries . 1 ) syntactic data like these can tell us what speakers feel belong together . is the / @ v / a verb ? a preposition ? this data does n\\'t answer those questions , but does tell us that ` wouldve \\' is being interpreted as a unit that behaves like an auxiliary verb . 2 ) intuition data can be supplemented with corpus data and experimental data . for instance , in pilot elicited imitation experiments where subjects try to repeat exactly what the stimulus tape says , i am finding that modal + adverb + have sequences are much more often repeated as modal + have + adv , than modal + have + adv sequences are repeated as modal + adverb + have . this is another way to show that ` have \\' ( often pronounced / @ v / or / @ / ) is , for some speakers , dependent on the modal . as for corpus research , i have diachronic data suggesting a historical trend in this direction . i am also working on comparing synchronic spoken vs . written data . 3 ) as part of my dissertation , i \\' ve been planning to get \" expansions \" of contracted forms , like what tom cravens described , and i am getting subjects from age 4 on up to as old as i can find . so hopefully in a few months i \\' ll have some systematic data to answer some of the questions that people have raised . by the way : does anyone have a good name for this type of construction ? the best i \\' ve been able to come up with so far is \" past counterfactual \" , but i \\'d prefer a name with a more syntactic , less semantic , sense . joyce tang boyland ( jtang @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) institute of cognitive studies , uc berkeley\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: summary : sri lanka\\n\\na few weeks ago i asked the following question : > could somebody please tell me how sri lanka is written and > pronounced in spanish ? is the pronunciation uniform across latin > america ? my reason for asking was that one of my students , a peruvian , told me it was pronounced / esrilanka / . yet i seemed to recall that a mexican had once told me it was / sirlanka / . as you will see below , i was wrong but only partly . here are the responses i received : en reponse a ton mail sur la prononciation de sri lanka en espagnol , je peux dire qu \\' en amerique du sud ( chili , argentine ) , on prononce et on ecrit siri lanka . my latin american friends tell me \\' sri lanka \\' is pronounced just as one would expect : sri lanka ( with the dental-alveolar [ r ] and the velar nasal . ) they say it is spelled as you have spelled it . en respuesta a su pregunta sobre la escritura y la pronunciacion de sri lanka en espanol , le puedo decir lo siguiente : en cuanto a la escritura , si no me equivoco , se mantiene el original sri lanka . sin embargo , en cuanto a la pronunciacion , existe la tendencia general a intercalar una i de apoyo entre la s y la r : [ siri ] . ello no excluye que ciertos individuos , considerandose mas \" cultos \" y mas \" sabios \" , hagan el esfuerzo de pronunciar [ sri ] . esfuerzo que rompe con la tendencia del espanol de evitar toda s liquida . esfuerzo , por consiguiente , considerado \" no natural \" . con respecto a la pronunciacion en latinoamerica , no puedo decirle gran cosa . pero imagino que tambien se ha generalizado la tendecia fonetica a intercalar la vocal i . i pronounce it [ ezri \\' la \\' nka ] , r = trill , n = velar nasal in normal speech . in rapid speech the [ z ] assimilates to the following rhotic producing a sound of intermediate quality ( this assimilation is a well known fact of spanish phonetics in nonaspirating dialects described , for instance , in navarro tomas \\' standard manual ) . in slow speech [ esri \\' ] , without voicing . i am from spain . in aspirating dialects , it is [ ehri \\' ] ~ [ eri \\' ] . i am from seville ( spain ) . i write the name of the country as sri lanka . and i pronounce it / sri lanka / . ( i might also pronounce it as / esri lanka / ; but this is due to the fact that we do n\\'t like sequences / sc / as onsets of words . you may have already realized that if you have listened to spanish people speaking english . many of the them would say / espein / instead of / spein / ) . in argentina sri lanka is pronounced : [ siri lanka ] . the [ r ] sound is according to ipa : is a post-dental percusive sound . the [ n ] is velar . i just called my daughter who is a writer at la jornada , a local newspaper . she works in the economics section . she said that their spelling is just like english , although she supposes that some \" purist \" publications probably change the k for a c . she wrote sri lanka on a piece of paper and asked the 5 people who were in the office to pronounce it . she confirmed my own suspicion that people pronounce it as if it were in spanish - - two of them with a rather marked e at the beginning , which is what spanish phonology would require with st - , for instance . the rest of us tend to sonorize the s - , but that would be expected in mexican spanish anyway . so , her conclusion ( and mine - - we \\' re both speakers of spanish as a 1st lang ) is that it \\'s pronounced \" normally . \" she has worked with a number of argentine journalists and never noticed that they did anything worth noting , which means that they probably pronounce it just about the same . from : in % \" penaja @ wkuvx1 . wku . edu \" juan antonio pena as far as spelling , sri lanka is the spanish orthography for this asian country . as far as phonetics , the only thing worth noting is that we insert an \\' e \\' [ e ] sound at the beginning of the word sri . spanish does this with all words beginning s + any stop consonant . in spain , the name of the state is written as in english : sri lanka ( the geographical name of the island is ceilan - - with an accent on the \\' a \\' ) . the pronunciation ( in tv and broadcasting ) varies : some people says [ sri \\' lanka ] , some others [ esri \\' lanka ] ( r stands for the multiple trill of - rr - in spanish , the same sound as in perro ) . hear in spain we use to pronounce the name of the old island of ceilan in two different ways . the most common pronunciation is [ esrri lan , ka ] ( i use double r for the spanish hard r and [ n , ] for the velarized nasal sound ) . there is another pronunciation , not so common as the former : [ siri lan , ka ] . i do not know the origin of this one . so there you have it . my impression is that / esrilanka / is more common in spain , and / sirilanka / more prevalent in south america , but this is obviously not absolute . many thanks to all those who responded . marc picard\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: are most people bilingual ? - - summary\\n\\na few days ago i inquired about estimates of what portion of the world \\'s human population is bilingual . one motive i had in asking was to be able to \" shame \" my students into taking their language study seriously . \" be a mainstream human being ! \" , i would exhort them . i thank michael brody , eva fernandez , jussi karlgren , and ruth kearns for their informative replies ( insofar as there is information to be had on this topic ) . see reference list below . the authors point out that one problem with this question is the difficulty of defining \" bilingual \" , since most people so described are not equally proficient in both languages . some key excerpts follow : romaine ( 1995 : 8 ) : \" there are about thirty times as many languages as there are countries . this entails ( sic ) the presence of bilingualism in practically every country of the world . grosjean ( 1982 : vii ) estimates that about half the world \\'s population is bilingual . there are , however , no really precise figures on the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages . \" grosjean ( 1982 : 2 ) : \" it is an interesting fact that no really precise statistics exist concerning the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages . \" romaine ( 1995 : 9 ) quotes makey ( 1967 : 11 ) : \" bilingualism , far from being exceptional , is a problem ( sic ) which affects the majority of the world \\'s population . \" grosjean ( 1982 : 2 ) quotes lewis ( 1976 : 115 ) : \" bilingualism has been ( , ) and is ( , ) nearer to the normal situation than most people are willing to believe . \" end of quotations . you may remember that i asked if there were any _ principled _ estimates , and , so far as i can tell , the authors say little about the bases or reasoning behind their estimates . ruth kearns points out that \" estimates tend to come from the statistics on numbers of languages spoken in various countries and statisitics of population size in those countries . \" for me , it remains a wide-open question . jussi karlgren expressed an interesting hunch , \" . . . that the number of languages spoken has an inverse correlation with the average schooling of the general population in the area . \" rather than take this as a sarcastic commentary on the inefficacy of formal language teaching , i have taken the liberty of rationalizing it as follows : schooling tends to impose artificially a single standard language to the detriment of a plurality of languages spoken \" naturally \" . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = references grosjean , francois . 1982 . life with two languages . cambridge : harvard university press . lewis , e . g . 1976 . bilingualism and bilingual education : the ancient world to the renaissance . in bilingual education : an international sociological perspective , ed . j . fishman . rowley , mass . : newbury house . mackey , william francis . 1967 . bilingualism as a world problem / le bilinguisme , phenomene mondial . montreal : harvest house . mackey , w . f . 1976 . bilinguisme et contact des langues . paris : klinckseick . romaine , suzanne . 1995 ( 2nd ed . ) . bilingualism . oxford : blackwell . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = lee hartman ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu department of foreign languages southern illinois university carbondale , il 62901-4521 u . s . a .\\n',\n",

( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac \\'s , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i \\' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n\\'t say whether you \\' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can\\'t imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there \\'s no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n\\'t woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n\\'t all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add \" ex / n \" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you \\' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , \" as we saw in example \" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n\\'t mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your \\'s earch \\' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you \\' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked . ( just my $ 0 . 02 ) .

       " 'Subject: sum : metathesis\\n\\nback in may i posted a query on both linguist and an-lang ( austronesian languages and linguistics ) asking for references on treatments of metathesis using recent phonological theory . i was mainly interested in synchronic metathesis of c / v type , which occurs pervasively in dawan ( w . timor ) which i was doing a bit of work on . this is a summary of responses on both lists , which came from : juliette blevins , bob blust , jim fox , beth hume , greg kinkley , john mccarthy , andy pawley , john stonham , mark taber , and aone van engelenhoven . it turns out that metathesis has come to play a fairly important role in recent discussions of morphological and phonological theory . also more and more examples of metathesis as a synchronic phenomenon have been coming to light in various language descriptions . austronesian languages have provoked considerable interest , with rotuman probably the best known ( e . g . besnier 1987 ) , letinese ( van engelenhoven ) and dawan ( steinhauer , tarno et al . ) becoming better known in the literature , and ( chuck and barabara grimes p . c . ) a number of other languages of eastern indonesia exhibiting varieties of metathesis waiting in the wings for examination by theoreticians ( e . g . christensen and christensen 1992 ; coward 1990 ; coward and coward to appear ; marshall 1991 ; steven 1990 ; taber and taber 1992 - references provided by mark taber ) . metathesis is a relatively rare phenomenon in natural language . in a climate where theoreticians are wanting more and more to let universal principles and constraints explain the output of grammars , it appears to contravene constraints that both phonologists and morphologists would like to impose on languages . an important change suggested in autosegmental theory which was designed to accommodate some crucial instances of metathesis without appealing to movement rules , was the segregation of c and v tiers , applied to rotuman in besnier ( 1987 ) . since then moves have been made to make constraints and their interplay the foundation of theory more directly , and the trend seems to be towards abandoning such devices as tier segregation , at least in optimality theory . in optimality theory , one of the constraints suggested is that segments should preserve their linear order ( linearity : mccarthy 1995 ) . obviously overridden in heavily metathesising languages like dawan . in approaches within optimality theory ( mccarthy , hume ) one principle can dominate another principle , and therefore override it . in c / v metathesising languages , under certain conditions a principle demanding ( morpheme - or word - ) final closed syllables dominates others which would achieve contrary effects , allowing metathesis to occur [ apologies for mangling complex arguments in an attempt at one-line summary ] . another problem raised by metathesis in the realm of morphology is noted by stonham ( 1994 : 141 - 2 ) : \" it defies the use of concatenative accounts of morphological effects . . . it has been called upon as a key example of the need for process - based morphology in such works as anderson ( 1983 , 1992 ) , janda ( 1984 ) and zwicky ( 1988 ) \" . stonham argues to the contrary that difficulties encountered by combinatorial morphology in handling metathesis do not show that the theory is inadequate or processes like movement rules are needed : rather the difficulties reflect the fact that metathesis does not occur as a grammatical marker . he reanalyses several instances of apparent grammatical metathesis as resulting from phonological processes . this approach looks promising , at least for dawan , where much of the metathesis looks as if it could be ultimately prosodically motivated , although i can\\'t prove that right now . although blevins ( 1994 ) is more about such things as vowel length than metathesis directly , the approach , which emphasises looking at metathesis not as an isolated phenomenon , but in the context of a full prosodic analysis , is admirable . such analysis would need to take into account discourse conditioning too , as noted by mark taber for luang . references anderson , stephen r .

       " 'Subject: sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ?\\n\\nabout 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form \\' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon \\' , ` afro - asiatic \\' , and ` dano - norwegian \\' but ` sociopolitical \\' , ` socioeconomic \\' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american \\' by the fuller form ` african american \\' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american \\' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american \\' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black \\' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american \\' because she could n\\'t find ` afro \\' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white \\' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american \\' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american \\' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 \\'s . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire \" phenomenon \" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of \" pristine \" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i \\' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term \" black \" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term \" afro - american \" , but he rejected it on the grounds that \" afro \" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n\\'t want a term that would suggest merely \" americans who wear afro hair-do \\'s \" . \\' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african \\' to ` afro - \\' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american \\' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n\\'t consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american \\' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - \\' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac \\' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian \\' in favour of ` serbian / croatian \\' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - \\' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash \\' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ; i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan \\' or at least ` pan - european \\' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english ; only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it \\'s presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *\\n',\n",

( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and \" syntactic satiation \" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold \\'s post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters \\' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual \\'s attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson \\'s post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the \" scanting out \" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously \" great - - grammatical \" or \" horrible - - ungrammatical \" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed \\' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . \\' to quote from bruce nevin \\'s response : < < a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : \\' i think he used to be . \\' > > hudson \\'s previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term \" drift \" of linguists \\' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of \" judgment drift \" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as \" weak crossover \" or \" island constraints \" , for example ) may actually alter an individual \\'s criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual \\'s discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual \\'s personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener \\'s / reader \\'s focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , \" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . \" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , \" i \\' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n\\'t feel like a native english speaker ! \" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: sum : walloon\\n\\nseveral weeks ago i posted a passage in the local walloon of the bastogne area of belgium and asked for a translation . i had quite a number of responses , and it appears that the responders had a good time wrestling with the passage . here is the passage : i - gn-e ` a po ^ pre ` s kinze ans du d \\' ci , dj \\' asto amon albe ^ rt le ` yona ^ rd e ` t dj \\' rawa ^ rdo pace k \\' on m \\' avot dit k \\' ou profe ` sseu ^ r do se \\' mine ^ re vlot nos ve ` y po pa ^ rler do walon . dju m \\' sovin co k \\' dj \\' e ^ dmande \\' a c , \\' momint la : < < kin - a ^ dje k \\' il e ` , don c , \\' cure \\' la ?

\" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that \\'s what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre \\'s ident du muse \\' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite \\' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte \\' des lettres , universite \\' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n\\'t consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk\\n',\n",

fortunately the \\' 501 deal \\' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi \\'s blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n\\'t understand the \" major used - 501 deal \" in this context : \" what \\'s the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? \" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 \\'s in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more \\' hip \\' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 \\'s and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there \\'s a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 \\'s out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 \\'s , as rumour has it that used 501 \\'s are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 \\'s , what \\'s it all about \" 501 \\'s are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 \\'s are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi \\'s . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 \\'s are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you \\' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like \" cash for used 501 \\'s . \" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi \\'s were the prestige brand ; i do n\\'t know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . \" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal \" used 501 \\'s are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans \\' \" . witnessing a 501 deal \" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 \\'s , with \\'d eal \\' meaning \\' ( business ) transaction \\' , or \\'d eal \\' could mean \\' bargain \\' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb \\' witness \\' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . \" . cowboys like their 501 \\'s blue and stiff \" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n\\'t wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) \" . a used - 501 deal \" i \\' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for \" used 501s . \" \" 501 \" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i \\' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i \\' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i \\'d say that a \" major used - 501 deal \" is either a transaction such as the one i \\' m proposing for tomorrow or , because \" deal \" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like \" thing \" , a place of business where such transactions take place . \" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction \" \" a major used - 501 deal \" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . \" deal \" is so inarticulate a word that it \\'s not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to \" getting a good deal \" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n\\'t have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( \" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business \" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone \\'s having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for \" a major used - 501 deal \" . 1 . \" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans \" 2 . \" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand \" 3 . \" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans \" \" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition \\' to witness \\' - - at least when it means \\' to see sth . \\' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the \\' 501 deal \\' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . \" can best be paraphrased into : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi \\'s 501 . \" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n\\'t hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: disc . sex / lang\\n\\ni have been proceeding with a \" disc he / she \" theme . it has been somewhat expanded , and i would like to have it posted under the \" disc : sex / lang \" subject head . thanks , jw ] in the continuing discussion of pronouns , i \\' m making a summary and a shift . the shift is spurred by the necessity to widen the orbit from pronouns to \" sex and language \" , perhaps an inevitable transition . alexis manaster ramer ( see below ) has suggested that a discussion of universal male dominace in society / language should take place prior to one of pronouns . i willingly go along , but reject the misandrist characterization . first the pronoun summary . \" he \" summary in my \" he \" work , i have suggested that to understand the generic and proverbial uses of modern english \" he \" , one would have to integrate into their data the facts that 1 ) \" he \" as a feminine pronoun survived much later in historical english than is generally acknowledged , and that 2 ) the late-archaic english \" he \" , on the one hand , as feminine , had an association with the all-genders plural , and on the other , as a masculine , had an association with the singular and neuter . \" him \" and \" his \" were during middle english , and later , also neuter ( \" not one or the other \" ) pronouns , and the ontogeny of the modern paradigm must account for these facts . there are more than a few examples of \" he \" in a generic / proverbial context in which , if there is any sex distinction at all , it must be considered feminine , not masculine , as in the following ( _ piers plowman _ , walter kane - - passus vii , manuscript h3 , lines 235-36 ) : he that etyn here fode throw trauail god 3eueth they / she that eat / eats their / her food through work god gives hem his blissing that here liflode so wynneth them his blessing that their / her livelihood so earns . _ _ _ when the 18th century grammarians put the \" he \" rule on paper , the feminine morphology was not unknown , not yet forgotten . if gender feminists today put a gendrist interpretation on the grammarians \\' motives and on the evolution of the \" he \" rule , it is through historical oversight , to put it kindly , and not for , as some maintain , misogynist motives , conscious or unconscious . finally , i have challenged the interpretation of the \" worthiness \" doctrine . according to it , the grammarians of yore said \" he \" was more \" worthy \" . the word \" worthy \" has , i believe , been too quickly accepted in its old english root-meaning of \" deserving \" , whereas i have yet to see any contexts that contradict its other meaning , based on its other old english root , \" appropriate \" . are there any clarifying contexts ? please show i \\' m wrong . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sex and language alexis manaster ramer sent me a personal response to my ideas ; when i asked , he said i could post for general reading . ( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for \" girl \" , \" boy \" , \" marry \" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is \\' unmarked \\' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to \" generic he \" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun \" he \" , and we must \" blame \" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) \" dominated \" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl \\'s face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to \" women and children first \" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women \\'s power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of \" the mark \" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , \" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified \" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that \" woman \" and \" she \" are \" species \" terms which females \" have \" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a \" species \" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a \" genus \" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words \" tautonyms \" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : \" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ \" . is n\\'t this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , \" just \" a person . the jakobson book continues , \" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item \" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , \" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? \" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they \\' ve had \" no concept of sex equality \" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i \\' m somewhat sure you \\' re talking about \" rights \" . \" rights \" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss \" women \\'s equality \" and \" men \\'s equality \" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey\\n',\n",

\" is a european union funded project ( copernicus \\' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak !

       " 'Subject: sex bias and epicenes\\n\\nh . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna \\'s ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , & elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like \\' lumberjack \\' and \\' particpants in congressional sex scandal \\' used more with he than say \\' child , \\' or \\' teacher . \\' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let \\'s not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i \\' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n\\'t want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) \" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

i do believe that many traditions ( sexism being one of them ) and perspectives are partially conveyed through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today \\'s sexist interactive patterns are influenced - - among other factors - - by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master , or subjects their king . this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , using a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by males in our judeo-christian society is not as extreme as during the biblical times , but interestingly it is still inherent to male-specific discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i moved to the bible belt one year ago ( i spent 10 years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me , i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people \\'s life , the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use . i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer offices , insurance agencies , etc . ) than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u . s . i found this extremely interesting . > ( a ) i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves > believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to > women and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if > it were not accurate ) is what must matter to us as we discuss > sexist language . whether the perception is accurate is of no importance > in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is ? what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research , or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquired schemata ? studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic \" he \" retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural . obviously , the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change ? > ( b ) i do not make any necessary connection between oppression of > womn and oppression of black people at all . i simply used the > example of black slavery as an example of the general principle that > to admit the existence of a form of oppression practiced by some > group ( by white people ) does not mean that one must necessarily > hate them . my point was that i am not a mysandrist just because > i accept that men have historically not been very nice to women . you are absolutely right ! hate does not help any purpose nor does it improve communication . yet , black people needed the cooperation of open-minded white people to help them reach a status based on the principle of equality . the same applies to females who keep trying to communicate with males , and who meet open and understanding men whereas others still believe that sexism is a nonsense political issue brought up by angry feminists . before being a political issue , it is a serious social issue that needs to be addressed through mutual understanding and respect . if males refuse their cooperation , some females may end up hating men as a natural psychological reaction . simone de beauvoir wrote in her book the second sex that there is no black problem yet a white problem ( referring the civil right movement in the us in the 50 \\'s 60 \\'s ) , because so called black issues essentially stem from the whites \\' disciminatory attitudes . black problems can be addressed by first revealing the problem of racism , and then by educating people to open their mind to differences as an enriching asset to the society , not a sign of deficiency . likewise , women issues are primarily men issues , because we are still living in a world which has been historically organized by men who believed in female inferiority , whether politically , socially or linguistically . communication between men and women is therefore the key to social improvement , hence the social mission of our research in linguistics , considering that language use is a social phenomenon . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * je pense donc je baragouine . . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lydie e . meunier / department of languages university of tulsa / tel : 918 631 2813 ( o ) lang _ lem @ centum . utulsa . edu / fax : 918 744 1902 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n',\n",

       " \"Subject: phonemicity of writing\\n\\ni would like to get some estimate of what percentage of the world 's written languages are represented orthographically in a phonemic manner . more specifically , how many written languages are such that one can predict the phonological properties of a word - - - including stress , accent or tone - - - merely by consulting the string of symbols used to write that word , and without further information , such as the morphological structure of the word ? for a language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one could write down a set of rules for word pronunciation , and in the ideal case the number of rules would be within an order of magnitude of the number of graphemes . ( a few lexical exceptions do n't matter , as long as there are n't hundreds of them . ) i am leaving the sense of ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally a phonemic written representation implies that one can predict the surface phonemic representation from the written form of the word , but i would be perfectly happy considering a system to be phonemic if some more abstract level of phonological representation were represented , from which the surface phonemic representation could be predicted by regular phonological rules / principles . ( i should also note , to clarify the question further , that i am interested primarily in the correspondence between the written form and the spoken form for the the standard variet ( y , ies ) of the language , which the written form presumably reflects to some degree : i am not interested ( at the moment ) in dialects of the language which deviate to varying degrees from the standard . ) so , under this definition , spanish would presumably count as very phonemic since one can nearly always predict the pronunciation of a word , including its stress , from the orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while the actual set of phonemes in a word is mostly determinable by the set of graphemes used ( with the representation of glides being slight source of complication ) , the placement of stress requires some knowledge of the morphological class of the word ( following work of ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among the least phonemic , since the ` regular rules ' of pronunciation are themselves quite complex , and there are many lexical exceptions . the particular classification of the writing system as logographic , moraic or segmental is unimportant : in principle chinese writing could be classed as phonemic ( albeit with a rather large set of graphemes ) , but for the fact that especially among the more common characters there are quite a few with pronunciation ambiguities which can only be resolved using lexical information . i am familiar with several of the recent books on writing systems : but while these typically contain in-depth analyses of particular systems , as far as i can tell , nobody has done a survey of this kind . ( if on the contrary , someone can point me to a survey that answers this question , i would be most grateful . ) so , i would be very interested in getting as much information related to this question on as many languages as people are sufficiently familiar with . i think i already know the answer to these questions for the more familiar western european languages ( including some less familiar ones like irish and welsh ) , as well as romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese and malagasy . i would be particularly interested in knowing about languages for which writing systems have only recently been developed , or for which the spelling system has recently undergone a massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has it that in such cases the writing system should be very phonemic , but perhaps that is not always true . please send any replies to me , and if there are a sufficient number i will post the results of this survey to the list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com\\n\",\n",

       " \"Subject: the ldc united nations corpus\\n\\nin linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175\\n\",\n",

see esp . pp 13-22 on the illusion of equivalence . west 1973 - martin l . west : textual criticism and editorial technique applicable to greek and latin texts . b . g . teubner , 1973 . further information i gathered : i was told that what i called \" textual criticism \" is , nowadays , more commonly referred to as \" scholarly editing \" . another reference brought me to the interpreting ancient manuscripts web at http : / / www . stg . brown . edu / projects / mss / overview . html , which is devoted to new testament textual criticism ( and was very helpful , indeed ) . although i am confident that a thorough reading of at least some of the above-given sources will no doubt broaden my horizon and deepen my understanding immensely , my curiosity about the translation of philosophical texts still remains largely unsatisfied for the moment . to clarify what this curiosity is all about - here is what i consider to be peculiar to and characteristic for the translation of philosophical texts , say , some generalized observation from my specific situation as translating ancient indian and tibetan philosophical texts . - the \" temptation of consistency \" . once a text is acknowledged as being a philosophical work , it is invariably presupposed that it is consistent , coherent , and thoroughly rational . the author is not supposed to make self-contradictory statements unless some assumptions of the philosophy in question provide an explanation for these . while this presupposition is necessary and adequate to a certain extent , it tends to yield rather questionable results when uncritically combined with the \" temptation of evaluation \" , or the \" temptation of justification \" . especially when translating philosophical texts from foreign , \" exotic \" cultures , the translation does not only present itself as a translation , but also as an argument why the text in question merits translation in the first place . in other words : because of the marginalization of \" exotic \" philosophy - in the introductory classes of philosophy i got to hear at university , i was still told that there is no philosophy to the east of greece - , a translation has to justify its appearance by justifying that the translated text contributes to a presupposed universal philosophy in a relevant manner . this is highly problematic for various reasons . the specific factor i have in mind , however , is that , when a translator has decided upon translating an \" exotic \" philosophical text , the value and content of the text are beyond questioning - its philosophical character and quality are presupposed to an extent which can severely damage and undermine the very project of translation . \" mistakes \" which the author made ( statements which would render the text less valuable for comparative philosophy ) are tacitly \" corrected \" ( read : deleted ) , terminology is adjusted etc . - this phenomenon itself is grounded in the personal union of translator and historician , translator and interpreter , translator and commentator . while a translation of a novel can be done by one person , who is a translator in a more technical sense , and can be thoroughly researched in its historical impact by somebody else , who is a literature-historian , this is not only uncommon in the field of comparative philosophy ( or the study of other cultures \\' philosophies ) , but also hardly feasible - for in most cases , even the philological constitution of the texts in question has to be informed by the interpretation . this results in a quite difficult ( and peculiar ) position of translation in the whole hermeneutical process - in most cases , the translation will serve as a \" second-language \" - commentary to the translated texts , not presenting an otherwise inaccessible philosophical text in its own right to those who do not understand the source-language , but a ) justifying the constitution of the text , b ) clarifying the interpretation on part of the translator and c ) ( see above ) justifying the project of translation for those who not only do understand the source-language , but who are already basically familiar with the historical and philosophical environment . in this context , translation loses much of its \" mediating \" function between two languages , but becomes a tool of explanation , which , in some contexts , can even be dismissed with ( i have seen and heard many specialists in indian philosophy whose explanations are basically made up of sanskrit terms , only vaguely connected by english copula ) . while this can naturally be explained on account of different target audiences ( translations for specialists will be different from translations for non-specialists ) , i find that this different function of translation is not recognized within the \" specialists \\' \" group at all . in other words : criteria which would apply to judging a translation in a broader context ( e . g . a translation of a novel ) are applied to translations which are carried out in this specific context , without even considering a possible difference in the pragmatic environment . i would thoroughly appreciate any opinions on this , birgit kellner institute for indian philosophy university of hiroshima\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: sum : v - initial languages\\n\\nseveral weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre \\' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n\\'t know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the \" fossilized noun-class prefix \" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i \\' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk\\n',\n",

- note that \" dinar \" is actually of latin origin ( denarius ) , via greek . john cowan 2 . response : spanish and portuguese \" real \" mean \" royal \" ( the king \\'s currency ) . i have no idea whether this got picked up into arabic and cambodian as \" riyal \" etc . - - sanskrit \" rupaya \" ( \" rupee \" ) is different although at the moment i can\\'t recall what it means . michael a . covington the university of georgia , usa 3 . response : the czech currency unit ( \" crown \" in english ) is called \" koruna \" in the nominative singular . the form you gave , \" korun \" , with a long / u / is the genetive plural form , which has a zero ending and is used with numbers over 5 . therefore you get \" 1 koruna \" , \" 2 koruny \" , but \" 5 korun \" . the german word \" thaler \" ( whence \" dollar \" ) comes from an earlier word \" joachimsthaler \" , which designated a coin minted from the high-quality silver mined during the middle ages at the town of joachimsthal ( \" thal \" = valley ) , which now bears the czech name jachimov . jachimov is in the west bohemian region of the czech republic . james kirchner 4 . response : the russian word * rubl \\' * is not related to * real * , * rial * , etc . the word is an old past passive participle ( \" l-participle \" ) of the verb * rubit \\' * \\' to chop . \\' gold ingots were originally * chopped * into small ( eventually , circular ) pieces and used as coins . in contemporary russian , the past passive participle of this verb is * rublennyj * ( e . g . , * rublennoe mjaso * \\' chopped meat \\' ) . gary h . toops wichita state university 5 . response : \" real \" in portuguese / spanish is cognate with \" royal \" and \" regal . \" my hunch is because it was currency backed by the crown , but it \\'s a hunch . it would be interesting to be able to do something like prove that the spanish / portuguese used the term \\' real , \\' which was picked up by the moors and carried with islamic invaders into se asia . also difficult . the russian \" rubl \\' \" is a bit more than a hunch - - it derives from the word for \" cut \" : rubit \\' \\' to cut \\' , and other words . check out fasmer \\'s ( vasmer \\'s ) etymological dictionary , available in german or russian . i was told by a slavic professor that this is cognate to \" rupee , \" but the guy was going around the bend and could easily be wrong on that point . t . beasley ucla 6 . response : the rial words are all originally \" after f [ rench ] ( and sp [ anish ] ) models \" and are indeed cognate with royal . in england a gold coin of this name was issued in 1465 , and there were french , spanish and scottish coins of the same name over the 15 and 16c . the name seems to have travelled with the maritime empires . dollar also has a complicated history . starting as the english version of thaler ( a coin of the german states ) it then was used for the large spanish coin ( worth 8 reales ) of spain . because of the importance of the spanish maritime influence and of its currency , the term became very widespread and was used ( even in parts of the british empire , such as the straits settlements - - we still use dollars here in singapore ) in many places , including in the us . you cannot assume that the use of dollar is a sign of american influence . rupee is different , coming from a sanskrit word for silver , it is of indian origin . anthea fraser national university of singapore 7 . response : according to vasmer \\'s etymological dictionary of russian , rubl \\' ( gen . sg . rublj \\' a ( stress on ending ) ) shares a root with the verb rubit \\' \\' hack \\' and meant \\' hacked off piece of a grivna ( larger unit of currency ) \\' . gladney 8 . response : russian rubl \\' is not related to rial / real . it comes from a root meaning \\' cut \\' . the origin of the term is from silver bars from which sections were clipped off ( otrubit \\' in russian ) and used as currency . i remember visiting a church in moscow dedicated to the \\' cut-off head of john the baptist \\' ( otrublennoj golove ioanna predtechy ) . btw kopejka ( 1 \\\\ 100 of a rubl \\' ) means \\'s mall spear / lance \\' and comes from the depiction of st . george killing the dragon which was the symbol printed on it . the russian word for money - \\'d en \\' gi \\' - is of turkic origin and is one of several in the russian language coming from a turkic root meaning \\'s tamp \\' . incidentally , i \\' m pleased to see that the slovenian currency is the toler - one more from dollar . geraint jennings 9 . response : panamanians use the term real for a 5 centavo piece . it was interesting to me because the currency is in balboas & centavos , but , as with american money , this coin had its own name . as far as i know , it was the only coin that had its own name ( i lived there for 11 years ) . it was also a type of test in the marketplace to determine who was \" local \" & who was n\\'t . when the price quoted to me was \" 2 reales \" & i pulled out the exact change , they knew i was n\\'t a tourist ! the word real means royal in spanish , but i do n\\'t know why the 5 centavo piece would be called such . caroline l . steele university of hawaii 10 . response : according to klein \\' s comprehensive etymological dictionary of the english language , * rial * , * riyal * are from spanish * real * ( < latin regalem ) to which portuguese * real * is obviously related . i have no info on * riel * . the russian * ruble * and indian * rupee * are not related to the above nor to each other . they both come from indigenous words . marc picard 11 . response : according to the macmillan dictionary of measurement , the first real ( ` royal \\' ) was a small silver coin issued by the spanish royal mint . rupya ( > rupee ) is an ancient indian word for ` ( metal made into ) coinage \\' , and ruble may be related . dinar comes from latin denarius , a coin worth ten asses ( a word related to ace ) . anton sherwood 12 . response : . . . \" real \" was also the name of a old gold or silver coin in the kingdoms of castile , portugal and aragon ( later in spanish america ) . the first dated \\' real \\' was coined in castile in the middle of the 14th century . they were called \\' real \\' because they were coined by the crown , in opposition to local coins coined by bishops , counts and noblemen . according to my sources of information ( enciclopedia larousse -

       " 'Subject: re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days\\n\\nhere \\'s what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it \\'s difficult to even judge what \\'s going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in \" the demise of the whorf hypothesis \" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name \" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis \" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , \" who created the whorf hypothesis ? \" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the \" principle of linguistic relativity \" or the \" linguistic relativity principle \" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word \" hypothesis \" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf \\'s \\' principle \\' into a ( n ) \\' hypothesis \\' , and why ? it was n\\'t whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it \\'s just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf \\'s \" linguistic relativity principle \" have to do , if anything , with einstein \\'s \" relativity principle \" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , \" is whorf \\'s relativity einstein \\'s relativity ? \" ) . ah , now we \\' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker \\'s stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker \\'s quoting whorf correctly , which he did n\\'t , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you \\' re using . well , that \\'s what whorf said too ( see heisenberg \\'s lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named \" principle of linguistic relativity \" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n\\'t make any sense until you see it in action , in \" an american indian model of the universe , \" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of \" time \" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world \\'s grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of \" time \" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n\\'t write and would n\\'t agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf \\'s relativity principle had something important to do with einstein \\'s ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that \" no one has disproved whorf \\'s mild version of linguistic relativity ( let \\'s leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) \" , even the mild version was n\\'t his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n\\'t hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n\\'t , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n\\'t hold it because it \\'s at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what \\'s going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won\\'t read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you \\' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n\\'t realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i \\' ll explain . i \\' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it \" heisenberg \\'s lament . \" you see , early in this century , that \\' uncertain \\' heisenberg was among the first to gain a \\' glimpse \\' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , \" we have reached the limits of our language . \" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no \\' things \\' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there \\'s nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as \" same \" and \" different \" are useless . he did n\\'t know then , and physics does n\\'t know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just \" rehpi \" , \" flashed \" , instead of \" it \" or \" the / a light flashed \" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is \" light \" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered \\' light \\' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it \\'s viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n\\'t seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n\\'t have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the \" rheomode \" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an \" inny / outty \" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm \\'s terminology and whorf \\'s terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf \\'s answer to heisenberg \\'s lament in \" an american indian model of the universe \" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here \\'s the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the \\' timeless \\' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm \\'s book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf \\'s description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n\\'t remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called \\' independent verification \\' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can\\'t speak for the hopi people , but that \\'s pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one \\'s own country / discipline ! ) . but we \\' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg \\'s lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it \" the subatomic realm \" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it \" the spirit realm \" . now that \\'s a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let \\'s take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n\\'t know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single \\' noun \\' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf \\'s reply to heisenberg \\'s lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you \\' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n\\'t even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of \\' karma \\' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for \\'d irect object \\' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for \" language and thought \" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that \\'s why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of \" thinking for speaking \" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: sum : german / english translation software\\n\\na little while ago i posted a query about peoples \\'s experience with power translator ( professional ) software for german - english translation . here is my colleague \\'s summary of responses via this and other lists . 1 . a second hand comment that someone working in art history had found it unsatisfactory 2 . another said that the canadian government uses the power professional ( french ) programme for translation work 3 . another said that the french version gave quite comical or incomprehensible results , but this was on the basic version , not the professional . one conspicuous difficulty was with words which can have the same form as different parts of speech ( eg gerunds ) ; another was variant word order . 4 . someone said ( another second hand comment ) that it was \" ok for the first cut \" . 5 . a response from the correspondent of an owner of the basic german programme who sent some samples with commentary , showing that as long as you knew both languages and edited the text during translation the results could be satisfactory , but whether the degree of efficiency offsets the time taken to use the programme was not apparent . this correspondent referred to it as a \" toy \" . 6 . a response from an academic who worked on the ibm translation product who referred to a german computer journal which rated the ibm programme slightly better ( and cheaper ) than the power professional . the reference is _ dos die pc zeitschrift _ 8 \\' 95 pp128 - 132 . it is apparent that simple constructions and explicit vocabulary translate more accurately than the complex and allusive , so the satisfaction given will depend very much on the nature of the task and the needs or expectations of the user . for scanning large volumes of print to ascertain the general subject matter these programmes are probably quite satisfactory ; for accurate translations , interactive operation by a translation-competent person would seem to be necessary . i have not yet decided to buy one of these programmes : i await a sales person who is prepared to run the risk of a trial translation on text supplied by me . no satisfied user came forward . andrew carstairs - mccarthy department of linguistics , university of canterbury , private bag 4800 , christchurch , new zealand phone + 64 - 3-364 2211 ; home phone + 64 - 3-355 5108 fax + 64 - 3-364 2065 e-mail a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz\\n',\n",

further , other areas that might use language interfaces such as games and program internal \" help facilities \" are also quite primitive . granted , the difficulties of trying to get a program to account for pro - - blems of meaning have occupied programmers for years , but this in itself is not sufficient enough explanation for why we do not see more results in areas that require a program to exhibit a sophisticated understanding of the structure of human language . which brings me to the point of this query . to improve my understanding of this problem and perhaps to generate some meaningful dialog about this problem , i would like to propose the following list of what we should minimally expect of a program or a theory of syntax that claims to be able to handle the structure of human language . i would like to invite readers to add to the list or to point out which areas have already been adequately handled . if an area is adequately handled , i would like information on how to receive the software that is available . i divide this list into three basic areas : 1 ) minimum requirements for linguists , 2 ) minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax , and 3 ) minimum requirements for translation technology . i . minimum requirements for linguists . a program or a theory of syntax that is to be programmed must minimally be able to : 1 ) provide a full labelled bracketing of any string ( including information about intermediate and maximal level nodes ) . 2 ) provide the parts of speech of all items in a string 3 ) provide the parts of a sentence ( subject , direct object , etc ) of a string 4 ) provide acceptability judgements for sentences that can be parsed ( e . g . john1 likes himself2 is parsable but unacceptable ) . 5 ) provide judgements about topicalized sentences , fronted wh questions , tough - movement sentences , relative clauses , noun clauses , cleft and pseudo - cleft sentences , pied - piping , the complex np constraint , control sentences , parasitic gap sentences , island conditions , the that trace effect , the coreferrence requirements of pronouns and reciprocals , and strong and weak crossover effects . 6 ) perhaps provide explanations for why particular parses fail . ii . minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax . a program or theory of syntax that is to be of value in these areas should minimally : 1 ) provide information about part of speech 2 ) provide information about part of sentence ( subject , object , etc ) 3 ) provide demonstrations of grammatical constructions e . g . make passivesentences from active and active from passive , make questions from statements , join two sentences into one using a variety of conjunctions , transitions and prepositions . 4 ) provide judgements about errors in the production of sentences 5 ) provide information about types of clauses : subordinate / main , adverb , noun etc . 6 ) provide information about sentence type e . g . simple , complex , compound , etc . 7 ) analyze punctuation of words , phrases , and clauses ( including coordination ) . minimum requirements for translation technology : 1 ) provide a correct parse for the subject language and provide a grammatically correct sentence in the target language . 2 ) provide acceptability judgements and other grammar checking of sentences in both languages . 3 ) be able to do convert some sentences in both languages : e . g . statement to question , active to passive and so on . this list might be short in many ways , but i think it illustrates my point . there is a lot more that could be happening in the realm of computational syntax , but it is not happening . if i am overly pessimistic , i would like to know where i can find software that can do the above . i will post all responses to the list as a summary . also , if anyone would like to add to this list , i will keep track of the responses and post them to the list . also , if someone can explain what prevents these developments i would appreciate that as well . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaii . edu\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: sum : c gemination ( syntactic )\\n\\ncontent - length : 10885 summary of data on syntactic gemination of consonants a couple of weeks ago i posted a query on what i termed \" syntactic gemination \" , for which i got information from no fewer than 15 respondents . i am very grateful to them all . here they are , listed in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondents : prathima christdas ( prathima . christdas @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca ) lance eccles ( lance . eccles @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ reading . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcia haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillips ( john @ ccyi . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) mari siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinki . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . cis . yale . edu ) the term \" syntactic gemination \" was not specific enough , as i had in mind only gemination at word boundaries , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundaries . nevertheless i will mention such cases as have been pointed out by respondents . besides , in my haste , i had forgotten to mention classical greek , which i had also taken into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here are the data : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this is the \" raddoppiamento sintattico \" of central and southern italian . nevertheless the conditions under which this appears seem to vary considerably among the dialects ( and the speakers ? ) . for instance , the example \" a casa \" [ a \\' kkasa ] , taken from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) is not accepted in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these languages the definite article / ha / triggers gemination of the initial consonant of the following word ( except for certain consonants ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammars by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation is that a proto-article is reconstructed as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / has su : s / , then reinterpreted as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis has been connected with the arabic data : the final c of the article / ? al / is assimilated to the initial c of the following word ( at least for the socalled \" sun \" cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson adds this : in tunisian arabic there is a clearer case ( @ is schwa ) : shaaf - @ t \\'s aw - 3sf \\' \" she saw \" shaaf - @ tt-u \\'s aw - 3sf-3sm \\' \" she saw him \" the doubling is done to maintain syllable structure , but this is not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this does not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / goes to / rr - / under certain conditions after a word ending in a short final v . in epic texts , or in other dialects , this gemination is extended to other sonants : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attested in boeotian these four languages were the only instances known to me when i posted the query . incidentally , note that they are different from the cases of latin \" hic \" and \" hoc \" , which were pronounced / hikk / and / hokk / before a word beginning with a v . the form / hokk / is original ( and / hikk / analogically modelled after it ) , so that diachrony forces us to say that / hokk / is simplified into / hok / before a c - initial word . here are now the additional data kindly supplied by my respondents , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccles , siiroinen , strade ) there is consonant gemination at word boundaries in certain cases in finnish . it is morphologically conditioned though it is \" syntactic \" . several morphemes or forms trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota \\' take \\' / otas se \\' take it \\' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle \\' i - give to-you \\' / annan sinullek kirjan \\' i - give to-you a book \\' ) , most of the nouns ending in - e ( kirje \\' a letter \\' / kirjet tuli \\' a letter arrived \\' ) and so on . other examples : in some negative forms : * en mene sinne * ( i do n\\'t go there ) , pronounced20 * en menes sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a \" la \" mene sinne * ( do n\\'t go there ! ) , 20 pronounced : 20 * a \" la \" menes sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so called \" 1 . infinitive \" : * ha \" nen pita \" isi tulla ta \" nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta \" nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination is the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mentioned infinitive form . this consonant was assimilated to a following consonant . while it disappeared without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the following consonant was retained . this feature is n\\'t marked in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christdas , wiltshire ) tamil has gemination of word initial stops following words with some case markings ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be found in christdas , prathima ( 1987 ) \" on constraining the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil \" in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( eds ) proceedings of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination is also found in malayalam , a closely related language . a . 8 - celtic languages ( phillips ) the celtic languages have \" mutations \" , changes to the beginnings of words due to their syntactic environment . types of mutations include prefixing of h or n to a vowel and voicing , devoicing , nasalising , etc . , of consonants . one of the mutations in old irish was gemination . the welsh spirant mutation is historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . ci \" dog \" , but tri chi \" three dogs \" , cath a chi \" a cat and a dog \" , though gemination in old irish occurred in a much wider range of environments . some of the mutations in breton are realised phonetically as gemination , though spelt otherwise . on other cases of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fulla , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agents of passive clauses ( ie . \" by \" - phrases ) are marked not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition has been ellipted ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seems to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as pointed out by nevin , in many languages , some phonotactic effects apply only in certain syntactically defined domains , for example , in roots or in verb stems , but not in affixes . hale adds that the number of languages which show this process is quite large . for instance there are some oceanic examples . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter is to be believed ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such processes . here are a few specific instances : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / is geminated to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compounds , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) has an inflectional form ( for aspect marking ) that involves deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant is geminated , or / y / is inserted an geminated if there are not the requisite number of syllables . so we have falama ` return \\' becoming fallaama ` finally return \\' while ala ` arrive \\' becomes ayyaala ` finally arriv e \\' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao is a language spoken at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebrides ) . when the direct object is incorporated in the verb , the initial c of the verb is geminated . examples , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he is fishing fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fishes fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l \\' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . realis sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n \\'s inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa \" open o \" in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil adds this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( \" pi99el \" ) is formed by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowels . now in most part , the binyan system is considered \" derivational \" and hence not , strictly speaking , syntactic ; however , in some cases , the 2nd binyan is the \" transitive \" or \" causitive \" of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) does have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quoting verhijde : your question touches upon the fields of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination is in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there are languages that appear have morphological / syntactic triggers for c - gemination . there is a huge bulk of material on sandhi - effects , as for example the italian rs case you mentioned in your query . perhaps ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connected speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i was thinking ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination is really : share melody . or in more abstract terms : share [ x ] . if this is correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fula , southern paiute and celtic languages ) under syntactic considerations may become very interesting for you . thans again to all of you who generously answered my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: lg & species\\n\\nthe language & species discussion has not recurred this week , but i had already prepared the following , which i think would be of general enough interest to the recurrent misunderstandings about innateness and human language to publish on the list . since my last posting on the language & species discussion i have received some interesting comments and checked on the reference that i had in mind ( since i own a copy ) . the reference is a volume called \" speaking of apes : a critical anthology of two - way communication with man \" . eds . t . a . sebeok & jean umiker - sebeok . ny : plenum press , 1980 . in it is chomsky \\'s article : \" human language and other semiotic systems . \" pp . 429-40 . chomsky \\'s article is pretty much as i remembered it , but with a great many other observations on the nature of human language , characteristic of his concept of human language , which contrast / s with what the animal psychologists of the time had taught apes ( and perhaps even thought of teaching them ) , e . g . , potentially infinite embedding of phrases within other phrases . beyond that , he challenges the notion that human language is ( merely / primarily ) a system for ( social ) communication , which serves his notion of the inappropriateness of comparing human language with animal systems of communication for drawing conclusions about the evolution of human language ( and may also imply that it is a strictly human device for interpreting external stimuli and \" thinking \" ) . incidentally , my rereading of the article changed my earlier impression that chomsky lacked \" grace \" in not explicitly acknowledging the accomplishments and discoveries of animal psychologists , to a perception that such explicitness would be irrelevant and distracting to the points he wanted to make . of course he could n\\'t help activating involuntary visceral hostility in some researchers when he accused them of lack of logic in their arguments , but that is another matter . most interesting was his final position that regardless of what apes may prove capable of learning , he saw evidence for a qualitative distinction between the human and ape natural intellectual endowment in the fact that humans acquire most ( syntactic ) properties of language without ( even the possibility of ) explicit teaching , while apes obviously do not , despite the \" evolutionary advantages \" ( c \\'s phrase ) that it would bestow on them . i particularly liked the last sentence of the following passage : \" now it is difficult to imagine that children learning english receive specific instruction about these matters , or even that they are provided with relevant experience . in fact , we find that while children make many errors in language learning , they never make such mistakes as these : they never assume , until corrected , that \" the candidates wanted me to vote for each other \" means that each candidate wanted me to vote for the other . in fact , relevant experience is never presented for most speakers of english , * just as no pedagogic grammar would ever point out these facts . * \" p . 432 to tell the truth , i do n\\'t get the error in the example ( maybe because i \\' ve never been corrected ? ) , but i get the point . it \\'s the point about anaphoric reference that i mentioned in the last posting ( though i think the passage is trying to rely on some point about syntactic embedding of anaphora of the type common at the time among generativists , cf . the parallel reflexive \" the candidate wanted me to vote for ? him - / herself [ unstressed ] \" ) . in any case , one might argue ( i would not ) that there is an anthropocentric bias inherent in chomsky \\'s perspective on the \" evolutionary advantage \" of human language - - i would suppose stemming from what i think is the evolutionary tenet that whatever promotes indefinite increase of the population of a species is an evolutionary advantage , since that is supposed to maximise the chance that at least some of the members of the species will survive to continue the reproduction of the species . i guess an objection might be that in some sense apes \" know \" something that we do n\\'t know that makes them shy away from retaining or developing something like human language , e . g . , that the technological advances allowed by human social organization and motivation facilitated by language will eventually lead to our extinction , a notion that would probably have evoked more rhetorical sympathy in the mid 1980s when fear of nuclear holocaust peaked ( or more persistently but less clearly the malthusian notion that uncontrolled human population increase puts dangerous pressure on the ecological support system ) . i doubt such an objection has any chance of being taken seriously ( in the form just given at least ) by the scientific spirit . imagine the unimaginable that some human society ( any human society ) came to this conclusion and rejected human language as ultimately threatening to the species . even so , i would guess that the innateness hypothesis would predict that humans would still not be able to \" help \" learning and manifesting language ( manifesting - - ) learning by future generations ) , and if that would contribute to eventual extinction , too bad . nothing in evolutionary theory prevents \" defective \" aberrations from arising . the species with them would simply arise and then disappear ( relatively quickly ? ) . however , i \\' m sure humans are constitutionally incapable of seeing the human language faculty as such an injurious aberration - - i can\\'t . at worst i can only see it as a possible means of salvation from the jeopardy that some of our more sinister instincts may have placed us in . forgive me for even inventing what i consider an idle and repulsive speculation - - but i think it throws in relief what might be inferred in assessing chomsky \\'s ultimate argument as i understand it . the simple summation of chomsky \\'s argument is : if apes are capable of learning \" human \" language , why do n\\'t they ( do it naturally - - like people do ) ? probably more interesting and arguable to the list discussion is chomsky \\'s point of distinguishing \" human language \" and \" language \" . chomsky sees human language as a subject for scientific inquiry with properties which are quite specific , including the syntactic properties of reference , embedding , etc . that we are all familiar with as current linguists . in contrast , my understanding of the article is that he sees \" language \" as a non-scientific concept , something vague and not even promising as a potential scientific field of inquiry . in this vein , he concedes that apes and many other animals may - - in fact , he does not doubt - - make use of symbolic systems ( semiotic systems ) apparently comparable in principle to the lexical component of language in some way , though less extensive , and , if i understand , less discrete ( in the linguistic sense of \" discrete \" ) . and he supposes that such symbolic systems in other animals may be related to shared intellectual capacities of humans and these other animals , but that with humans they interact with distinctive linguistic capacities ( among the latter i suppose the way lexicon fills in more abstract linguistic categories in grammatical derivations ) . in an illustrative passage ( p . 437 ) he objects to the gardners \\' characterisation of teaching apes to use ameslan lexical signs as teaching them ameslan as a ( human ) language . by the way , he considers acquisition of the sign for \" and \" as trivial , with respect to comparison with human language . i do n\\'t suppose that that is meant to detract from recognition of the apes \\' ability to grasp this \" logical operation \" ( by human definition ) - - but that such recognition is irrelevant to an appreciation of what is distinctive about human language ( well , at least we now know that the \" logical \" concept \" and \" is not distinctive to humans - - the concept \" plural \" , then , probably is n\\'t either - - more problematic is the concept \" dual \" as far as i know - - have apes been taught to count ? hey ! last time i looked i had three identical rubber ducks , now i only have two ! ) . in sum , then , chomsky has a very specific and single-minded notion of human language which allows him to immediately \" see through \" claims about animal manifestations of \" language \" , just as it had earlier allowed him to criticise ( and condemn ) skinner \\'s notions about the \" nature \" of human language . i think the usual difficulty in seeing his point is not so much in the persistence of linguistic debate about whether and to what extent \" autonomous syntax \" is a valid notion ( let \\'s not get into that here ) , but in the intuitive notion among linguists , as well as everybody else , that lexicon is a major \" part \" of \" human language \" . it is certainly not the part that chomsky associates with the distinctive innate human faculty of language . rather , the innate faculty is somewhere in the systems which organise combinations of signs , that \" somewhere \" being crucial to whether or not there is an evolutionary discontinuity between human language and animal potentials for \" language \" . of course , another source of resistance to the idea of an innate human language faculty is a generalised sneaking suspicion that anything that proposes to set humans apart from other animals in a fundamental way is self-deluding anthropocentric self - aggrandising propaganda , cf . the discredited ( i think ) argument against the heliocentric theory of the solar system that humans are the \" center \" of creation and therefore their location must be at the pivot of the material universe . while sneaking suspicions are certainly appropriate issues to bring up for something as informal as the ling . list discussion , it is not clear to me how it fits in to more formal scientific argument . misguided as a source of resistance would be the idea floated in the kant / innate discussion that a theory that something is \" innate \" is a killer to further attempts at \" explanation \" . the killer to explanation is the \" just \" in \" that \\'s just the way things are \" . on the contrary , take out the \" just \" and there would be nothing to explain if there were no \" that \\'s the way things are \" . if we get confused about this , it \\'s because , as scientists we don \\' t know how things are , and our \" explanations \" are hypotheses to test if things are the way we think they are . i forgot what the context of kant \\'s discussion of \" explanation \" was , but in the context of \" pure \" reason it would have to be the \" just \" . in \" practical \" reason i suppose whatever aids remembering the \" facts \" is sufficient \" explanation \" . finally , a message from massimo piattelli - palmarini , director of the dept of cognitive science at the istituto san raffaele in milan , alerted me that among the discussion of comparisons between human and ape cognition relevant to language capacity , \" the truly definitive piece is by mark seidenberg and laura petitto in cognition , vol 7 , 1979 , pp . 177-215 . \" although this article was published before the volume i referred to above , it was too recent for most of the papers published in that volume to fully discuss , so that there are only glancing references to it in some of the papers . i still have n\\'t read it yet , not that i \\' ve even read most of the articles in the sebeok volume . incidentally , massimo reminded me that apes were indeed found to be able to recognise their reflections in mirrors , monkeys not ( and i think i read that in roger fout \\'s popular book about teaching apes to communicate with humans which came out in the late 70s ) . from what i gather , animal psychologists etc . are not ( or no longer ) hostile to the idea of a discontinuity between human language and what animals are capable of , but remain ( why not ? ) interested in discovering of what animals are capable of , and what that might suggest about human evolution . benji\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: ipa , austerlitz\\n\\ni learned phonetics and phonetic field technique from robert austerlitz ( 1923-1994 ) . after reading joseph stemberger \\'s comments on ipa and democratizing the process of standarizing phonetic writing ( in linguist 6 . 185 ) , i thought about how austerlitz taught . austerlitz never asked us to memorize ipa or any other system . instead , he taught us several different systems of notation all at once . he expected us to be able to describe sounds by place of articulation , manner of articulation , and so on . we were expected to + know + ipa , of course , and he referred us to several different sources , each of which had a slightly different version of it . but there were no standard systems in his classroom . he was a remarkable teacher and made me a fieldworker . he used a number of symbols that are rarely seen anywhere else . one of his favorites was the cardinal vowel \" 61 \" , by which ( if i remember correctly ) he meant the high back unrounded vowel written \" turned m \" in ipa . this \" 61 \" was merely the letter \" uy \" from the cyrillic alphabet . in his field-technique classes , we were encouraged to make up new symbols to describe what we heard . i remember , during a session with a speaker from shanqhae , he expressed the greatest pleasure when joseph davis wrote the initial consonant of \\' cooked rice \\' with a digraph made up of a \" v \" with a lowercase \" f \" planted between its arms . this expressed graphically the unusual shanqhae sound that davis had described - it was clearly a labiodental fricative , but somehow sounded both voiced and voiceless at the same time . austerlitz first mentioned that \" they \" in the ipa would say that diacritics could be used to express this , then recounted chao \\'s claim that many chinese dialects have initial consonants that are in-between voiced and voiceless , and went on to discuss ways that he and others had thought of to write this . actually , though , the use of those ipa voiced / voiceless or breathy voicing diacritics might not be quite right . the \" voiced \" initials in shanqhae lower register words are neither contrastively voiced nor contrastively unvoiced ; the apparent \" breathy semi-voicing \" seems actually to be feature of the + tone + , not the initials . some speakers pronounce it with the initial , some before the initial , some afterwards , some all the way through the syllable , and some not at all . davis \\' symbol was a good idea at the time , though , because it expressed this lack of contrast vividly . i have met quite a number of linguists who have complaints about ipa or about the variety of systems in use , but these people hardly ever seem to be fieldworkers . i do n\\'t believe i know any two fieldworkers who use phonetic symbols quite the same way , and most of them do n\\'t seem to care at all . everyone seems to have different preferences ; well , so what ? some people , for instance , can\\'t abide to write the \" h \" for aspiration + above + the line , and write it seemingly as a full segment . others leave the \" h \" out altogether , saying that ( in english , for instance ) it need not be written explicitly . the chinese tend to write aspiration with the reversed apostrophe of greek , probably continuing the tradition of older systems of romanization . the chinese , in fact , have a whole class of vowels - frictionless sibilants - that have n\\'t made their way into ipa , as well as a special set of alveolo-palatal consonants . are these really necessary ? maybe not , but the chinese are not going to give them up ; be sure of that . for my part , i dislike plain schwa - i prefer to use the four schwa-area vowels ( close-mid and open-mid , rounded and unrounded ) that ipa now recognizes , and even before they became official i was using some of their current symbols , although i sometimes used special diacritics with schwa , too . these vowels are important in some of the areas where i work , in rural fwujiann . but every chinese dialectologist i know uses schwa like mad , and for a number of vowels that i consider quite distinct . we understand each other , though . fieldworkers are basically explorers . for the most part we do not go into the field to codify the known , but search for the unknown . we play with our symbols , try different ways of writing things , develop habits of transcription that are as distinctive as handwriting and reflect different ways of interpreting sounds . it is natural in these circumstances that different standards should take shape . fieldwork is an adventure , and transcriptional practice reflects that . i can\\'t imagine why anyone thinks we need a single , \" democratically devised \" standard . ipa of some sort is good enough for most people who actually use it , and if someone does n\\'t like it , he or she will borrow from some other tradition - american , perhaps - or invent another . if i want to look at that person \\'s notes , i will just learn the system - it might take as long as 10 minutes - and that will be that . where is the problem ? why should i trade my freedom of transcriptional expression for a rigid code ? why would that benefit me ? no , the \" chaos of multiple standards \" that stemberger mentions does n\\'t bother me at all . there + are + two things that do bother me , though . one is the frequent changes in ipa that have been bandied about recently . when the kiel version of ipa was first promulgated , i was aghast at the large number of weird-looking symbols . then came the revision of kiel , and things were different again . i do n\\'t mind adjustments , as long as they are introduced very gradually . like the agreement a couple of years ago that + either + way of writing \" g \" was acceptable - that only took a few decades to get straight . the idea that lots of changes have to be introduced and introduced right away frightens me a little . that is n\\'t to say i do n\\'t enjoy hearing the different proposals people advocate , but i will probably still stick to my own transcriptional habits , even so . the other thing that bothers me is the mob of systematizers , standardizers , formalists , and unificationists who seem to pop up everywhere in linguistics like dandelions by the side of the road . to my mind , formal systematization is the enemy of good fieldwork . and if a democratic vote + is + ever taken on the subject of phonetic alphabets , i hereby move that it be restricted to people who do a + minimum of 100 hours of fieldwork or acoustic measurement + every year for their own , fresh research . as for the rest of you - you are welcome to listen , enjoy the show , but please do n\\'t try to tell me my business . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )\\n',\n",

( i \\' m using calvert watkins \\' dictionary of ie roots , houghton mifflin , as reference . ) * * * david gamon ( gamon @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) writes : enantiodriomia refers to the diachronic process of acquiring an \" opposite \" meaning , and i suppose a word having two such meanings would be an enantiodrome . i learned this , by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . enantiodromia of modals / attitudinals the first example of such a word i had drawn to my attention is * doubt * , which historically has a meaning such that to doubt that something be true meant to suspect it to be true . in some parts of northern england , i \\' m told , it still has this meaning . this was brought to my attention by professor bill stewart at cuny . another example i \\' m familiar with is the english modal * must * , which is reconstructed as meaning \" to have freedom or space \" ; the gothic cognate meant \" to be free or have permission ( to do something ) . \" there are two classes of explanation offered in the literature for this particular example of enantiodromia . first explanation : negation drops out klaren ( 1913 ) and antinucci and parisi ( 1971 ) propose that the semantic shift took place in a negative context , as follows : neg ( free to do x ) - - ) compelled ( neg ( do x ) ) given the equivalence of a lack of freedom to do something and a compulsion to not do something , an innovative \" compulsion \" semantics was reanalyzed from the \" freedom \" semantics in a negative context with concomitant scope change of the negative operator . the reanalysis is made esepcially perspicuous given a & p \\'s notation , which decomposes the older meaning of the modal ( freedom / persmission ) into the primes neg ( bind ( neg ) ) : if one is free to do something , then one is not bound to do it ; if this is negated , the first two negs cancel out to leave only the narrow-scope neg , with a resultant meaning of bind neg or \" compelled not \" with narrow-scope neg , as follows : cause ( x ) ( neg ( neg ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) ) ) [ = j . may not go out ] - - - ) cause ( x ) ( bind ( neg ( john goes out ) ) ) [ = john must not go out ] the same sort of explanation could be applied in reverse to the german modal * duerfen * , which underwent a semantic shift from an original \" necessity \" or \" compulsion \" semantics ( cf . mod . germ . * beduerfen * \" need , require , \" * duerftig * \" needy , poor , lacking \" ) to the modern \" permission \" meaning : bind ( neg ( do x ) ) - - ) neg ( free ( do x ) ) however , the a&p notation fails to link the conservative and innovative senses in a natural manner . second explanation : antithetical nature of modality the other kind of explanation has been proposed by breal ( quoted in bech 1951 , p . 19 ) , visser ( 1963-73 , p . 1797 ) and traugott ( 1989 ) , and basically proposes that permission is used as a polite way of imposing obligation , with the implication subsequently being semanticized , or the originally indirect speech act giving way to direct , conventionalized coding . one might see the same sort of shift occurring in present-day english in contexts that suggest that this sort of explanation may indeed be valid , as in \" you may leave now . \" one can see from this , at least , that what counts as an \" opposite \" is largely a matter of the scale one implicitly chooses along which to arrange the items at issue , or the specific semantic prime upon which one chooses to focus . also , one would n\\'t even think of conceptualizing the innovative meaning as antonymous if most of the conservative meaning were n\\'t being preserved intact . another example is * prove * , which in middle english meant something like \" to test , \" or in a legal context , \" to put on trial . \" when the expression \" the exception proves the rule \" was coined , it quite logically meant that an exception or counterexample to a generalization or claim makes you question the generalization or that the exception so to speak puts the rule on trial . as the verb * prove * shifted its meaning 180 degrees , the expression , illogical though it then became , was preserved simply because it \\'s so handy - - whenever someone presents counterevidence to your claim , you can write it off as \" the exception that proves the rule \" !

with the first period on a low pitch and the second one higher and much louder . the second period has emphatic stress , i . e . , is higher and louder than the first , which has end-of - sentence pitch and a stress . as for other examples , the only ones that come to mind right now are those involving the decimal system : in french , one says \" sept virgule trois \" for 7 , 3 just as we say seven point three . this must have parallels in other languages . by the way , since you are interested in this , maybe you \\'d enjoy hearing the phonetic punctuation routines of the danish - born pianist and comedian victor borge . he has a system of indicating punctuation by means of various mouth-noises , usually as rude as possible , which makes for some hilarious patter . it has been a long time since i heard him , but i believe his records are still available . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * robert dale ( rdale @ microsoft . com ) what \\'s your take on the use of the word \" parenthetically \" as in parenthetically , i should say here that . . . stretching it a bit further , how about \" item \" in the following ( not at all convinced by this one but just in case ) : there are some things we should get straight here . item : no smoking in class ; item : no eating in class . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \" karen s . chung \" ( karchung @ ccms . ntu . edu . tw ) this happens when certain words are borrowed from the local dialect , \\' taiwanese \\' ( or \\' southern min \\' ) , into the standard national language , mandarin , via latin letters to represent the taiwanese sound . e . g . a local variety of lettuce is called in taiwanese e5 a2 chhai3 , and perhaps most people call it by its taiwanese name rather than its mandarin name , wo1 ju4 . but then it became common to represent the taiwanese term in writing thus : a cai4 . people subsequently started pronouncing it like it was written , which is quite unlike the taiwanese compound on which it was based . the same has happened with the taiwanese term for \\'s pringy \\' ( in reference e . g to rice ) : khiu7 became q . this raised the tone from a middle level to high level ( there is no middle level tone in mandarin ) . i can give you a reference on this : hansell , mark ( mhansell @ carleton . edu ) . _ the sino - alphabet : the assimilation of roman letters into the chinese writing system _ . philadelphia : sino - platonic papers , no . 45 , may 1994 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * peter - arno coppen ( u250005 @ vm . uci . kun . nl ) i think the quotation marks can also be expressed by a characteristic intonation pattern ( starting the quoted part with a new tone word , with l * hl intonation ) . also , pronouncing quotation marks with \" say \" seems ( in some cases ) to be appropriate : i think that , say \" intelligence \" , has something to do with it about the origin : in the sixties / seventies , the danish comedian victor borge was rather successful with his \" phonetic puntuation \" , in which he e . g . \" pronounced \" quotation marks with two clicking sounds , accompanied by the finger sign you mentioned . this will surely not be the origin , but i saw many people imitating him since then . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \" dr . christian k . nelson \" ( cnelson @ vm . cc . purdue . edu ) i \\' m not sure , but think that what you \\' re interested in might overlap with the phenomenon of \" reported speech , \" which bakhtin and his circle dealt with . perhaps there is a better reference for their work , but the one i \\' m familiar with is v . n . volosinov \\'s ( 1973 ) _ marxism and the philosophy of language _ ( cambridge , ma : harvard univ . press ; l . matejka & i . r titunik , trans . ) . i should note that some believe this book was actually authored by bahktin , but bears volosinov \\'s name for political reasons . anyway , part 3 seems pertinent to your interests . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * philippe mennecier ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr the same phenomena exist in french : on a coutume de penser que les vrais hommes ( entre guillemets ) ne montrent pas leurs e / motions .

( not that it is really important ) . some people replied with examples of languages with object affixes , whether or not the languages in question also had affixes indicating other grammatical relations . matthew dryer replied with the following list of languages which have object affixes but no subject affixes ( taken from an a database mentioned by him in language 1992 ) : africa : central khoisan ( nama ) , ijoid ( kolokuma ijo ) , gur ( bimoba ) , east chadic ( kera ) , biu-mandara ( margi , mbara ) , west chadic ( ngizim ) . eurasia : nax ( ingush ) , avaro-andi - dido ( avar ) , lezgic ( archi ) , munda ( mundari ) . se asia oceania : nicobarese ( car nicobarese ) , central-eastern malayo-polynesian ( kiribatese , ponapean , woleaian ) . north america : pimic ( papago ) . south america : warao , maipurean ( palikur ) . i have not been able to follow up on all of these refs . i have however , looked at the micronesian languages . 3 ) discussion of a few languages sohn ( 1975 ) re woleaian : object suffixes , but no affixes corresponding to any other grammatical relation . 3sg has three forms : zero and - y / - w . it seems that verbs fall in to two classes , with zero being added to verbs in one class ( many of whose members appear to have a tr suffix ) and - y / - w to members of the other class ( the choice in forms being phonologically conditioned ) . interestingly , 3pl distinguishes animate vs inanimate , whereas all other persons and numbers do not . these affixes can occur with or without an overt independent object np . these affixes occur on certain post-verbal advbs , suggesting that they might in fact be clitics . zewen ( 1977 ) re marshallese . pronominal objects immediately follow the verb . 3sg and 3pl are enclitics and undergo vowel harmony . these enclitics can co-occur with lexical np object . ' subject ' prons are all independent . groves , groves and jacobs ( 1985 ) re kiribatese . it seems from their description that the language has object suffixes but no other affixes indicating grammatical relations . however , there are things which could perhaps be analyzed as subject prefixes ( p1 08 ) . exactly which object suffixes get attached ( out of 11 classes ) seems to be lexically determined . 4 ) general discussion it would appear that there are no cross-linguistic studies of object affixes per se . some respondents questioned whether the object suffixes in roviana are really suffixes and not just clitics . they are suffixes , but even if they were n't the focus of my interest would be the same . i am focussing on two facts about roviana : ( a ) the case marking on np 's is on an ergative-absolutive basis , but the only grammatical relation indicated by verbal affixes is object . ( b ) of the object affixes , only 3pl has zero form . being functionally inclined , i am interested in finding a motivation for ( b ) . it is not simply a case of referentiality ( see the brief sketch below ) . 5 ) refs ( with diacritics mangled by the internet ) corston , simon h . 1993 . ergativity in roviana . ma thesis : auckland university , new zealand .

' ( animals , 034 ) ( the paper i am writing now clarifies why i only put erg in parentheses - it is really unmarked , and you have to infer in this context that the pron = erg because there is no particle ) kote arina tie mae magu-i - 0 sarini fut pl man come carve - tr-3pl . do 3pl . abs ' the men will come and carve them up . ' ( feast , 016 ) ( them = pigs in a feast ) nb , here the do is the pron sarini . however , you can get the affixes even if there is no overt do np , suggesting that they have independent reference , e . g . ai lul-i - u mo intj follow - tr-1sg . do dt ' hey ! follow me .

( see ma ) roviana has case marked and quantified np 's . case ( erg , abs , obl , etc ) is indicated by articles before the np . quantifiers ( numbers , 's ome ' , ' all ' etc ) precede the head n . non - specific undergoers obligatorily occur in a backgrounded object construction . compare the following two examples . raro talo si gami cook taro abs 1pl . excl ' we cooked taro ' / ' we did some taro cooking ' it is difficult to say if ' talo ' is ' incorporated ' since there are no other indep elements assoc with the verb which ever come after . note that the backgrounded constr is intr , with no transitive marking , and with the actor as s . compare to the ' usual ' order vao raro-a gami sa talo cook - 3sg . do 1pl . excl def taro ' we cooked the taro .

( in essence , i \\' m talking about some kind of a dp - analysis . ) since possible noun phrase interpretations differ minimally across languages ( i guess ) , we would then assume that in languages without articles , the functional projection associated with the semantic properties in question would have phonetically empty heads . the possible tendency of acquiring articles could then be explained as a strive to fill this / these head / s with overt elements . unfortunately , i cannot say that i so far have any reason to be convinced about this line of reasoning , but i can\\'t see any obvious reason to give it up either . however , i am ready to be butchered . i should probably read the following references provided by john e . koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) ) greenberg , joseph h . 1978 . how does a language acquire gender markers ? pp . ) 47-82 . in : universals of human language , vol . 4 , ed . jos . h . greenberg , ) et al . stanford , ca : stanford university press . ) discusses evolution of gender marking from articles and articles from ) demonstratives . see also : ) greenberg , joseph h . 1981 . nilo - saharan moveable-k as a stage iii article ) ( with a penutian typological parallel ) . journal of african languages and ) linguistics 3 : 105-112 . those interested in definiteness , especially with respect to english and finnish , should consult the following work provided by deborah d . kela ruuskanen ( druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi ) . ) chesterman , a .

) his life \" . nevertheless , my theory is that in my rush to learn english i made the following logical leap . \" to risk your life \" is to risk something good , so you should risk \" winning t he game \" , not \" losing the game \" . risking fines , death , imprisonment and cancer were later experiences for me . i \\' m quite sure \" risking life \" was the first ex pression i heard . by the way , i \\' m not at all sure that i differ from others on our favorite gallicism of \" running the risk of / that [ something bad happening / will happen . \" , so that \\'s a different expression . i kinda doubt that genuine dialect differences are respo nsible for differences in \" risk \" - - only idiosyncratic differences in generalisations , some of which survive contradictory data learned later - - an interesting point that has been made before in language acquisition theory . among the interesting comments i received which suggest to me that relatively discrete semantic splits may result from such processes , and even become genuine dialect features is sandi michele de oliveira \\'s observation that in south texas the expression \" trying to get sick \" can be used for \" about to get sick \" . i wonder if \" trying to rain \" could mean \" threatening to rain \" in such dialects . of possibly different origin is the ambivalent serbo - croatian verb \" sumnjati \" ( = \" to doubt \" or \" to suspect \" ) . balsa stipcevic indicated that : \" sumnjam da je on to uradio . \" can have two meanings : 1 ) \" i suspect that he did it . \" 2 ) \" i doubt that he did it . \" here i suppose that the verb might have started off neutral to the belief status of its sentential complement , but it remains interesting that there is such a glaring pragmatic ambiguity in what a speaker might be implying . maybe english \" wonder \" is similar . \" i wonder if he did it \" . if he says he did , then the sentence would seem to suggest that i doubt it , but if he says he did n\\'t , it would seem to mean that i doubt that . i \\' m not gonna torture myself trying to figure out whether the same context - ualisation differences work for \" i wonder if he didn \\' t do it \" , but maybe someone / body else wants to give it a shot . i wrote back to balsa that i hoped his comment on this verb is more generally agreed upon by serbo - croatian speakers than my comment on \" risk \" . - - benji\\n',\n",

( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english \" lecture \" is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg \\'s book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n\\'t seen the product i \\' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu\\n',\n",

( 1 ) looking up \" grasshopper mind \" in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i \\' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ ; e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) : \" 2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour ; an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 . \" and the near-synonym \" grasshopper brain \" is webster \\'s third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2 \" light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future . \" ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : ) \" grasshopper mind \" is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone \" has a grasshopper mind \" means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning \\' frivolous , careless , \\' the semantics of \" grasshopper mind \" are fairly self-explanatory . ( 3 ) dating the \" grasshopper mind \" coinage is moot . harding says : ) i \\' m sure it \\'s not particularly recent in origin . . . . i \\' m pretty sure it ) must be possible to trace early uses of the phrase \" grasshopper mind . \" sieling suggests checking aesop \\'s \" the ant and the grasshopper , \" and funk & wagnalls new standard dictionary ( 1913 ) defines _ grasshoppering _ as : \" 1 . an unsettled and unsteady course of life ; improvident living : from the fable of the grasshopper and the ant . \" ( 4 ) \" grasshopper mind \" has cross-linguistic analogues . schaufele describes it as : ) like all those complex words in german that you can\\'t find in ) any dictionary but which are crafted for the nonce by completely ) productive strategies and are perfectly understandable to any ) reasonably-intelligent speaker of the language ( i had to coin one ) of these myself the other day , \\' lehrgangsprotokoll \\' , to mean what ) we mean here by a \\'s chool transcript \\' ) . spackman thinks \" grasshopper mind \" reads like a loan translation of a foreign expression , and mentions an interesting ojibwa calque : ) the phrase \" fire stick \" which has been given in novels and movies ) to ignorant american natives is apparently a literal , morpheme-by - ) morpheme translation of the ojibwa word for a gun . except for one ) thing : it \\'s not stupid . \" fire \" here translates \" launch a projectile \" ) and \" stick \" is the classifier for a rigid rod . \" rigid projectile ) launcher \" is not so snappy , but a rather tighter word than \" gun \" ) do n\\'t you think ? the semantically transparent \" grasshopper mind \" reveals a lexicographical gap between english dictionaries published in the united states and the united kingdom . while unknown to most american anglophones and familiar to many uk anglophones , lexicographers have overlooked this metaphor for orthopterous mentality . modern lexicography is benefiting from computerized corpora and machine-readable dictionaries . for instance , searching for adjectival _ grasshopper _ + noun combinations in cobuilddirect \\'s on-line corpus ( direct @ cobuild . collins . co . uk ) reveals three occurrences of \" grasshopper mind , \" two of \" grasshopper warbler , \" and one each of \" grasshopper leap , \" \" weather , \" and \" nijinsky . \" many dictionaries enter _ grasshopper warbler _ ( locustella naevia , characterized by its buzzing call ) but none _ grasshopper mind _ . further research is necessary . any information about this expression \\'s historical origins or distributional usages ( seegmiller asks about australian english ) would be gratefully welcomed . michael carr , otaru university of commerce , otaru 047 japan email carr @ canal . otaru-uc . ac . jp fax 81 + ( 0 ) 134-22 - 0467\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: sum : function words\\n\\ni . the question and its motivation three weeks ago or so , i asked linguist readers to help me find examples of function words with unusually specific meanings . this was meant to elicit examples that i could mention in a paper called \" the formal semantics of grammaticalization \" , where i discuss what happens to the meaning of a content morpheme that develops into a function morpheme . i argue there , developing work by other semanticists / logicians , that ( 1 ) function morphemes do have meanings ( contrary to a widespread assumption ) . just consider that the meanings of quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are the bread and butter of us working semanticists . ( 2 ) there is a class of \" logical \" meanings that have certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , there is no perfect correlation between logical meanings and functional morphemes . there are lexical / content morphemes with ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives \" same \" , \" mere \" , \" alleged \" , verbs \" deny \" , \" believe \" , nouns \" majority \" , etc . ) . and there might be functional morphemes with non-logical meanings ( hence the linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus there is not much that we can say about what happens to the meaning of a morpheme that is becoming grammaticalized . although i make some presumably doomed efforts . the finished paper ( which is based on a talk i gave at the nels 25 workshop on language change ) will appear in the nels 25 proceedings ( to be available from the glsa at umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . the paper is downloadable by anonymous ftp from the following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps i would welcome any comments . ii . some of the responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) the reference [ to the pejorative pronouns \" you shit \" ] ) is samuel elbert \\'s grammar of ) rennellese / bellona , \" echo of a culture : a grammar ) of rennell and bellona \" , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication no . 22 ] . ) ) a few interesting cases of ) grammaticalization of a somewhat relevant ) type do exist . in micronesian languages ) there are a set of verbal affixes for ) directionality ( up , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards some third ) party [ the usual deixis system ] ) which ) also include \" toward the open ocean \" ) and \" toward the lagoon \" ; whereas ( of course ) ) if you want to say \" toward john \\'s house \" ) ( or some other nonce collocation ) ) you need to use a pp . ) ) similar , but probably not similar enough , ) is the bizarre use of the cardinal directionals ) in icelandic documented in a classic paper ) by einar haugen ( i can dig up the reference ) if you really want it ) . it seems like , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , and having ) a rather uneven fjorded coastline , to go ) to a city which was north of you actually ) involved heading out in a southerly ) direction ( all that time ) .

       " 'Subject: sum : more discussion of human and non-human language\\n\\ncontent - length : 18462 there \\'s been a fair amount of discussion about language among non-humans , both publicly on linguist and privately with me , since my previous summa - ry in linguist 6-28 . i have already posted to linguist a bibliographical list , broadcast in linguist 6-195 ; here follows a summary of some of the main points that have come up in discussion . first of all , i \\'d like to thank the following people who posted messages to me personally : dan alford , a . k . a . moonhawk ( dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu ) celso alvarez - caccamo ( lxalvarz @ udc . es ) rachel lagunoff ( ihw1009 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) dorothy hinshaw patent ( doropatent @ aol . com ) john e . limber ( jel @ christa . unh . edu ) alex schwartz ( alex _ schwartz @ sagepub . com ) andrew spencer ( spena @ essex . ac . uk ) mike tomasello ( tomas @ fs1 . psy . emory . edu ) bill turkel ( bill @ hivnet . ubc . ca ) george williams ( gww @ navisoft . com ) in addition to these individuals , the following people have posted items on the subject of language among nonhumans to linguist since 6-28 . i \\' m going to focus less on these in the following summary , on the assumption that most of you have already read what they had to say . lloyd anderson ( ecoling @ applelink . apple . com ) sherri l . condon ( slc6859 @ usl . edu ) jane a . edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) larry gorbet ( lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) gilbert harman ( ghh @ princeton . edu ) marion kee ( marion . kee @ a . nl . cs . cmu . edu ) bob krovetz ( krovetz @ cs . umass . edu ) roger lass ( roger @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) david pesetsky ( pesetsk @ mit . edu ) benji wald ( ibeneawj @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) sherman wilcox ( wilcox @ alcor . unm . edu ) one major issue that came up in discussion was the methodological and ethical justification of evaluating the linguistic ability of non-humans by confronting them with the task of mastering a language belonging to homo sapiens , instead of by investigating the means by which they inter - act amongst themselves . in linguist , benji wald pointed out that chomsky himself , in a paper pub - lished in the sebeok / sebeok vol . mentioned in my bibliography in linguist 6-195 , carefully drew the distinction between \\' human language \\' , the cog - nitive system built into the * human * brain that enables us to master the various human languages that are the raw data of our studies , and \\' lan - guage \\' ( which i shall in this posting capitalize - - not to be confused with lsa \\'s journal ) , the set of all possible similar systems , in whatever species ( or machine ) they may manifest themselves . this phase of the dis - cussion began with the question of the relation between an ability to re - cognize one \\'s image in a mirror and an ability to handle pronouns of vari - ous sorts , including reflexives . ( briefly , dogs and cats are able to re - cognize their reflections as members of their own species but consistently treat them as \\' others \\' , behaving toward them as they would to strangers of their own species ; roger lass has suggested that the ability to re - cognize the reflection as \\'s elf \\' may not be evolutionarily advantageous to such predatory animals . the anthropoid apes , however , manage after a few minutes to realize that the reflection is \\'s elf \\' , at which point they switch from the \\'s ocial \\' behaviours they would normally use to make the acquaintance of strangers of their own species to using the mirror as a tool for self-inspection . but there has been no evidence presented , to my knowledge or that of anyone else on the list , that chimps , gorillas , etc . have any ability to handle anaphoric reference the way human apes do . sherri condon referred us to the work of her colleague at the univer - sity of southwestern louisiana , daniel j . povinelli , on this subject . ) but ultimately this discussion came back to a fundamental issue raised in my previous summary : even were it possible , through ingenious programme design and / or arduous effort , to teach a real human language to a chimp or a gorilla , the mere fact that the system in question would have to be \\' force-fed \\' , as it were , is evidence in itself that there is a serious difference between the cognitive systems of the two species ( human and non-human ) in question , since humans pick the stuff up with almost no training whatsoever . since much of our research programme is dedicated , more or less directly , to investigating the ability of humans to learn individual human languages \\' naturally \\' ( i . e . , with a minimum of effort ) - - at least in childhood - - this unredoubted fact places the linguistic abilities of non-humans at a significant distance from our discipline \\'s focus area . whether the field of linguistics ought to broaden its focus area to include non-human quasi-linguistic semiotic / communicative systems is another question , of course , that was raised in private discussion with me . speaking for myself , i am very sympathetic to the notion of embedding ( to use a very professional word ) linguistics as we now under - stand it within a broader programme of research into language , including the semiotic / communicative systems of non-human animals . supposing that such animals could accomplish the task of mastering a hu - man language ( which has so far not happened ) , this would certainly prove that the difference in species is not relevant to the nature of the lan - guage in question , much less language in general . but failure to accom - plish the task is not as probative , since it can be interpreted in either of at least two ways : ( 1 ) the animals in question are no more than \\' protolinguistic \\' ( to use bickerton \\'s term ) , unable to master a system of the complexity of human language - - a quantitative evaluation . ( 2 ) the animals in question are already in possession of an equivalent system of comparable complexity but of incompatible organization ( which ipso facto interferes catastrophically with the proposed task ) - - a qua - litative evaluation . which of these alternatives is correct will require a completely diffe - rent set of experiments , carefully studying the communicative behaviours natural to these animals as we linguists study the communicative beha - viours natural to humans . one of my correspondents said , \\' why is all this effort devoted towards teaching apes a modified version of english ? a complex and highly social species such as this has an extremely sophisticated natural communication system of its own , yet we know very little about this . . . surely , before embarking on experimental meddling of dubious methodological validity , it would be more prudent to construct a research program aimed at mapping out the cognitive abilities of the various species and more particularly , their home-grown communication systems . presumably , it \\'s only against the background of how apes communicate with each other in the wild that we will really be able to interpret the kinds of artificial experiments pio - neered by the gardners and others . . . when you provide the reference list it would be extremely interesting ( though a lot of hard work ) to compare the amount of research effort expended on teaching apes 2 - year old english , compared to the number of studies devoted to ethological study of ape communication . \\' a further , related issue was the epistemological question of how to reco - gnize behaviour in another species that is equivalent to language in hu - mans . i remarked myself at one point , \\' human language is not purely a communication system , and its structure is not based solely on its commu - nicative function . i use language for a variety of functions . . . it does not strike me as logically self-evident that all of these functions should be served by the same system . i can imagine a species that en - gaged in all of these behaviours but used a radically different system for each . would we be able to recognize all these different systems ? and would all of them properly fall into the field of inquiry we call \\' lin - guistics \\' ? larry gorbet , in his linguist posting , touched very well on a further as - pect of this problem , addressing in particular one of the criticisms that has been made of the results achieved by the gardners et al . \\' any formal element whose meaning includes displacement ( or more generally , * any * fairly abstract meaning ) will be intrinsically difficult to recognize as such , simply because the \" search space \" ( for the observable behavior that points to meaning ) is so large . the result is an * intrinsic * sample bias in semantic analysis : concrete meanings are more likely to be * disco - vered * than are more abstract ones , relative to their actual frequency of occurrence . in addition to abstract meanings in the more obvious sense , meanings which concern internal states ( e . g . \" emotions \" ) can be difficult to discern if one does n\\'t experience those states or similar ones . \\' a couple of references to the science fiction literature are relevant here , science fiction being often very useful for such \\' thought-experi - ments \\' in the einsteinian sense . h . beam piper , who while definitely not pc was brilliant , wrote a story called \\' naudsonce \\' ( pp . 57-112 in the col - lection federation , published 1981 by ace . piper suicided in 1964 , and i have no idea whether \\' naudsonce \\' was published anywhere during his life - time ) , in which an exploration party from earth discovers an extrasolar planet inhabited by an obviously sapient species which the explorers la - bel \\' svants \\' . these people are living at roughly a neolithic cultural / technological level , and there \\'s no question that they communicate by means of deliberately modulated sound waves transmitted through the air , so the humans immediately jump to the conclusion that they have something akin to what we call \\' language \\' , and the professional linguist they \\' ve brought along for just such eventualities gets to work trying to analyse the svants \\' \\' language \\' and establish inter-species communication . no go . turns out that although both svants and humans communicate by means of deliberately modulated , etc . , the resemblance ends there . our auditory systems ( by which i mean both the auditory centers of our brains and the neurosensory systems in our ears that serve as their input ) are designed to convert auditory impulses into a distinct sensory experience that we call \\' hearing \\' . the svants \\' neurosensory systems are designed to convert such impulses into something more closely approximating the sensory expe - rience that tells us about our internal states ( e . g . , feelings of hunger , thirst , satiation , heartburn , etc . ) . thus , when a human reports a feel - ing of pain or pleasure , another human apprehends the message intellectu - ally ; when a svant reports such a feeling , an equivalent feeling is di - rectly induced in the body of another svant . in order to have any hope of inter-species communication , the human explorers have to rely on two peculiar individuals : a young male svant who is as a result of a birth defect \\'d eaf \\' , but is otherwise quite intelligent and shows promise of being able to master an ideographic writing system , and his mother , who is \\' normal \\' but sticks with her son out of maternal affection , and can interpret for him to the rest of the svant community . my point in giving this rather lengthy summary is that recognition of the fundamental diffe - rence between the human and svant communicative systems constitutes a ma - jor , and very challenging , cognitive leap for the human explorers ; can we be confident that a similar cognitive leap would not be necessary for us in evaluating the cognitive behaviours of non-human apes , cetaceans , etc . ? ( piper , speaking through some of his characters , expresses scepticism that a species whose principal communication system so thoroughly bypas - ses the \\' higher / rational \\' cognitive centers can develop very far in the way of civilization . i personally do n\\'t share his scepticism . several of us during discussion have considered that cetaceans use sound both as their principal means of exploring the world around them , via sonar , and apparently to communicate . this suggests that a cetacean mode of commu - nication might involve \\' projecting \\' a sonar \\' image \\' of what one is talk - ing about into the listener \\'s brain . such projection may involve vocali - zation skill levels outside the abilities of cetaceans ; but assuming they could do it , i do n\\'t think such \\'d irect \\' communicative methods preclude a high level of civilization . i \\' m not sure they \\' re all that different from the ability of the chinese , or of fluent signers , to communicate highly abstract concepts by means of what is essentially visual imagery . ) those of you who have read suzette hayden elgin \\'s intriguing though dif - fuse novel native tongue may remember that in that novel , humans , having over the course of several decades established contact with a variety of alien species and managed to negotiate profitable trade deals with seve - ral of them in spite of the obvious language barriers ( the only reason the generally despised profession of \\' linguist \\' is allowed to survive in this crypto-fascist state ) , encounters a species that is obviously sapi - ent and obviously endowed with something in the way of a language ( if i remember correctly , it \\'s not made clear exactly how this is recognized ) , but that \\' language \\' is so radically different from human language in its structural organization that no human seems to be able to get the hang of it ( several people die trying ) . in both cases , we are left with the big question : what , exactly , consti - tutes language , or a \\' language \\' ? and how do we recognize one if it exists ? on the subject of the cognitive organization of the brains of non-human primates , steven pinker , on p . 350 of his recent book the language ins - tinct : how the mind creates language , discusses their equivalents of broca \\'s and wernicke \\'s areas : \\' the neuroanatomists al galaburda and terrence deacon have discovered areas in monkey brains that correspond in location , input-output cabling , and cellular composition to the human language areas . for example , there are homologues to wernicke \\'s and broca \\'s areas and a band of fibers connecting the two , just as in humans . the regions are not involved in producing the monkeys \\' calls , nor are they involved in producing their gestures . the monkey seems to use the regions corresponding to wernicke \\'s area and its neighbors to recognize sound sequences and to discriminate the calls of other monkeys from its own calls . the broca \\'s homologues are involved in control over the mus - cles of the face , mouth , tongue , and larynx , and various subregions of these homologues receive inputs from the parts of the brain dedicated to hearing , the sense of touch in the mouth , tongue , and larynx , and areas in which streams of information from all the senses converge . \\' for those of you who are interested , the relevant references are : deacon , t . w . 1988 . \\' evolution of human language circuits \\' in h . jerison & i . jerison , eds . , intelligence and evolutionary biology . new york : springer . - - - - . 1989 . \\' the neural circuitry underlying primate calls and human language \\' human evolution 4 : 367-401 . galaburda , a . m . & d . n . pandya . 1982 . \\' role of architectonics and con - nections in the study of primate brain evolution \\' in e . armstrong & d . falk , eds . , primate brain evolution . new york : plenum . beyond this , there is the fact that the integration of even complex so - cial systems is not enough to account for the complexity of human lan - guage . a large number of human social situations seem to be manageable by just a few dozen different utterances ; yet we have a natural linguis - tic ability vastly in excess of that . i suspect that our ancestors may have developed that ability through some nonce mutation , and then over the subsequent millenia have gradually developed uses for it . ( for some at least tangentially relevant thoughts on this subject , see theodore zeldin \\'s recently published intimate history of humanity , harper - collins . ) before closing this posting , i will quote the following from dorothy hinshaw patent \\'s message to me , and reiterate my plea in linguist 6-28 for more user-friendliness in our interactions with people who are rea - sonably intelligent , may be well-educated , may even be fellow scientists , but just are n\\'t linguists . \\' i was very frustrated by the critics of the ape language work ; they seemed to be looking for reasons to say the work did n\\'t have meaning , and i think your piece summarized many of the frustrations of people like me very well . would that everyone were able to think so clearly ! what i \\'d like to see is a linguistic analysis - - using minimal linguistic jargon , so zoologists and psychologists could understand it , too - - of the work done with apes , dolphins , sea lions , and parrots , comparing the \" accom - plishments \" of the different species to one another and to human chil - dren . i \\'d like the person doing it to make the assumption , as you have , that the work does have meaning , and go from there , rather than trying to find picky reasons for discounting it because of human hubris . \\' let us instead adopt the attitude expressed by sherri condon : \\' i think we have much to learn about cognition and communication in all species , and we are fortunate that careful researchers are on the job . \\' of course , as is always true not * all * researchers \\' on the job \\' are \\' careful \\' , by which i understand \\' responsible , not wedded to their hypotheses to such an ex - tent that they are unable to wrestle appropriately with contrary evidence or alternative approaches \\' , but the responsible ones definitely deserve encouragement ! best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *\\n',\n",

( naturally , i assume that a lexeme \\'s invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun \\'s gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i \\' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches \\' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes \\' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

       " \"Subject: workshop announcement articulatory databases\\n\\nworkshop on articulatory databases munich thursday 25th and friday 26th may , 1995 we are currently starting the preparations for a two-day workshop on articulatory databases . this will be the third in the series of workshops organized by the accor working group ( a consortium of phonetic institutes financed by the european community 's esprit programme ) and and follows the electromagnetic articulography meeting in munich ( april , 1992 ) , and the tongue modelling meeting in barcelona ( december 1993 ) . a few words on the aims of a meeting devoted to such an apparently dry topic : the basic premise is that the free availability of articulatory data could provide benefits in several partly overlapping areas : in basic research it could allow investigators to test hypotheses formulated in articulatory terms on a much wider range of data than the individual worker would normally be able to acquire or access unaided . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for deriving articulatory representations from acoustic data - relevant both for basic understanding of speech production as well as in potential applications such as speech displays for training the speech impaired . it could promote the development and testing of algorithms for speech synthesis / recognition using an articulatory level of representation . the aim of the workshop would be to generate an exchange of ideas among people active in these areas in order to identify , for example ( further suggestions welcome ) : 1 ) what articulatory data is in existence that it would be beneficial to make more freely available ( archival / retrospective approach ) ? 2 ) what standards should freely available data meet ? - specification of recording conditions - anatomical frames of reference - levels of accuracy / reliability - linguistic specification of the speech samples - preferred data structures for distribution . - any other issues relevant to the data being used without risk of misinterpretation by people not actually involved in the the details of acquisition articulatory data can come in many guises depending on the speech subsystem tapped into and the transduction technique used . thus , it is possible to monitor position ( 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions ) , force , emg , airpressure / flow with techniques that may be static or dynamic , may involve imaging or point-tracking etc . etc . we think that people directly involved in acquisition can also benefit from considering how techniques can be standardized to promote maximum comparability of recordings made at different sites and with different hardware . 3 ) in analogy to acoustic databases ( where unlabelled data is of only the most limited use ) , what segmentation and labelling information ( and tools for the exploitation thereof ) could / should be made available with the raw data to facilitate flexible access for different purposes ? 4 ) for future recordings , what categories of data and corpora would be potentially of most widespread use ? if you are interested in participating please contact phil hoole ( preferably by email ) at the address below as soon as possible . further information on registration and format for presentations will be distributed early in 1995 . please also draw this letter to the attention of any colleagues you think might be interested . phil hoole and hans tillmann institut fuer phonetik munich university schellingstr . 3 d - 80799 munich germany fax : + 49 89 2800362 email : hoole @ sun1 . phonetik . uni-muenchen . de\\n\",\n",

( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized .

( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint . ( 12 ) vicki fromkin announced that the international congress of linguists ( organized by the permanent international committee of linguistics , better known by its french initials cipl ) would be held in paris , in july of 1997 . ( 13 ) michael strauss , the director of annual meetings on the aaas staff and estrella m . triana , the senior program associate , aaas directorate for education & human resources programs were introduced . estrella triana announced that 1998 was the 150th anniversary of aaas and urged members to support the issuing of a aaas commemorative stamp . she also announced the fund raising drive for a new building , and reminded members that sections of the aaas were entitled to hold meetings in the aaas building in washington , dc . the meeting was adjourned submitted by v . fromkin , secretary section z = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = membership request form mail to : aaas - po box 2033 marion oh 43306-2133 or fax to ( 202 ) 842 1065 name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membership category : ( includes 51 issues of science ) * regular member $ 97 * postdoctoral $ 72 ( payment required with order , ) * student $ 50 ( payment & student id required ) supporting member $ 35 ( does not include science ) check enclosed _ _ _ bill me later _ _ _ ( regular members ) visa _ _ _ _ master card _ _ _ _ credit card number _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ exp date section z primary affiliation : _ _ _ _ ( check here ) * all include 51 issues of science .\\n',\n",

i have n\\'t seen copies of the work , but did adam bede do the same ? 2 ) building on ( 1 ) , i then ask , where / why did the idea of capitalisation arise in the first place ? in quite a number of other writing systems of the world , a method of marking \" important \" words with a larger , and slightly different version , of the \" normal \" sized letters is completely absent . thus , who / why / where did capitalisation come into being ? we take this so much for granted , i wonder if we can still re - / discover the reasoning behind this \" distinctiveness \" strategy . ( and as a final parting shot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english writing we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environments , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a printing influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small \" i \" in roman numerals ? ) . ) from talking to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , does not have this distinction . how about other language writing systems , european or not ? and what effect does this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that \" i \" is more important than \" you , them \" etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondents . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my questions - - either post to list or to me directly . regards to all , anthea . * * \" words do n\\'t mean , people mean . . . . \" * * ( have forgotten the author of this reminder ) . afb .\\n',\n",

( 2 ) computational models and ( 3 ) symbol grounding . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineers and scientists in neural networks and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers of mind , biologists and all of those interested in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problems . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` an introduction \\' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanisms of language \\' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language and exploration of an information space \\' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influences natural language descriptions \\' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` on grounding language with neural networks \\' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observations on symbol-grounding from a combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint \\' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols in sensorimotor categories with neural networks \\' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations \\' chairs + invited speakers s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments \\' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available from sarah leong at the above address and should be sent to the following address : ( it is not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution of electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member associations will be admitted at members \\' rates .\\n',\n",

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - many have pointed out that i could run linux ( freely distributed unix clone ) on my pc , and that it has great tex support ( ntex 1 . 3 ) . this turned out to be impractical for me . but it is an option i did not know existed : \" check out freebsd , freely downloadable from ftp . freebsd . org , or available as a cdrom from cdrom . com ( about $ 40 or less ) . you can maintain dos and unix on the same hardware and switch between the two , and therefore have your latex , too . \" 3 ) the commercial option : -

- - - - - - - - emtex seems to be the overall favorite for dos machines . it is said to be much more widely used ( than gtex ) and easier to install . a summary of how you can get it : \" the most painless way to get latex on your pc is to download emtex from the university of georgia ( ai . uga . edu , / pub / emtex ) . we give additional installation instructions besides those provided by the author . \" other cites : ftp . rus . uni-stuttgart . de / pub / tex / sytems / msdos / emtex and emtex-fonts ponder . csci . unt . edu [ 129 . 120 . 3 . 16 ] pub / tex / emtex ymir . claremont . edu [ 134 . 173 . 4 . 23 ] [ anonymous . tex . ibm _ pc . emtex ] there was also a particular enthusiastic endorsment of emtex for emacs users on os / 2 : \" i use the os / 2 version [ of emtex ] which is truly excellent ( not being limited by memory , it is much better than the dos version ) . there are also available for os / 2 , a graphical dvi viewer ( dvipm ) , ghostscript , dvips , etc . in addition , em has ported gnu emacs to os / 2 ( the current version is 19 . 27 ) . imho , if you are going to work in latex , you should be using emacs in latex mode as your editor . emacs + emtex under os / 2 has pretty much supplanted other use of word processing software \" 6 ) gtex - - - - - - - - the gtex package was said to be more complete ( amslatex , amstex , dviwin etc . ) and more windows - friendly than emtex . this is , more or less , what sold me on it . i got it from : gtex ftp . shsu . edu / tex-archive / systems / msdos / gtex1 . 0 for ms windows / dos users . microemacs for windows is the host interface whose menus allow easy access to tex / metafont / amspell / bibtex / etc . also included are complete macro sets for plain tex , latex , nfss , e - tex , amslatex , and amstex . one person who responded to my query commented that gtex is less mature than emtex . i must say that he is probably right . installation took me much longer than i anticipated . here is a summary of the problems and their workarounds : 1 ) to begin with , the main tex . exe in the base directory does not accept arguments . i may have missed something , but i could not make latex work by the standard $ ) tex &lplain ( file-name > what i got was simply the tex environment . i could , of course , load lplain at this point and then load my file . but this is rather cumbersome . i found a workaround through micro-emacs , which is part of the package . 2 ) i did n\\'t realize that if you unzip latex2e after unzipping latex , you clobber some of the latex 2 . 09 . sty files ( and you cannot use latex 2 . 09 as a result ) . there is a ( rather complex ) workaround and if you need latex2e only to begin with you are in good shape . however , it turned out that when you run latex2e . bat in the texfmts directory ( to generate the . fmt file for latex2e ) the name of the fmt file is latex . fmt , but it turned out that micro-emacs package expects a totally different fmt file for latex2e , namely a file called nfss2ltx . fmt . even changing the relevant bat file does not solve the problem . the only workaround i could find was to copy latex . fmt as nfss2ltx . fmt ( in short , if you do n\\'t want the hassle , install latex only ) . 3 ) the dviwin package for both previewing and printing ( written by hipocrates sendoukas ) is rather nice . the feature that generates missing fonts automatically is particularly useful if your disk space is limited . however setting this option to work right was difficult and the documentation is not very helpful . if you run under windows nt ( as i do ) this is what you need to do : o select options / missing fonts . . . o select the third option ( append line to file and execute command ) o in the line text box write : call genpk $ f $ m $ x $ y $ x $ y $ d $ p $ e o in the file text box write : x : \\\\ ( temp-dir ) \\\\ < batch-file . bat > where x : is your hard drive , temp-dir is the value of your temp environment variable and batch-file is an arbitrary name for a batch file that will generatte missing fonts . for example , i use the following text : c : \\\\ temp \\\\ missing . bat o in the cmd text box write : genallnt . bat $ ( temp ) \\\\ missing . bat where temp is the environment variable that contains the name of the directory in the file text box . note that in the cmd text box you need to use an environment variable ( you have to ) while in the file text box you cannot ( you must specify the literal name of the temp directory ) . it took me a while to figure this out and it was n\\'t fun . if you do it wrong , dviwin takes control over your entire operating system , firing up and killing dos widows in rapid succession . you cannot even use nt \\'s task list to kill the runaway process .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: est-ce que questions\\n\\nseveral weeks ago , i \\' ve sent an inquiry about is it that / est-ce que interrogatives to the list . many of you took the time to answer to it , so i feel very sorry for not giving any summary of the replies before today . i have written one in french , which i display here . if some of you would like a translation , please ask and i \\' ll write one . thanks again for your precious collaboration ! the inquiry was : j \\' ai rencontre l \\' enonce authentique suivant : why is it that ( people are never happy ) ? qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ais : pourquoi est-ce que ( les gens ne sont jamais contents ) ? j \\' aimerais savoir s \\' il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec : what , who , when , where or how ? what is it that you said / are saying ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? how is it that you did / do this ? where is it that you were / are ? sur les 54 reponses obtenues , 21 consistent en une phrase : \" tous ces exemples me paraissent acceptables et normaux \" . les auteurs des autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous les exemples egalement , mais avec quelques restrictions d \\' emploi que nous developpons ici . les quatre grands types de restrictions sont le registre de langue employe , la semantique de l \\' interrogative , la nature de l \\' adverbe interrogatif et le temps du verbe etre place avant \\' it that \\' . 1 . le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l \\' acceptabilite de la structure , comme le montrent les six remarques suivantes : \" alors que les phrases proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel , des equivalents plus courants [ colloquial ] seraient : you said / are saying whatj ? you met / are meeting whoj ? you met / are meeting her whenj ? you did / do this howj ? you were / are where j ? cet equivalent \\' courant \\' n \\' existe pas cependant avec why . je dirais plutot : people never seem to be happy . why ( is that ) j ? \" \" why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l \\' emploi de \\' that \\' marque un registre plus formel . \" \" les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . \" \" toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . \" \" j \\' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . \" \" je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n \\' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . \" les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d \\' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d \\' enonce est caracteristique d \\' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d \\' un proces ; mais c \\' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s \\' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes \\' why is it \\' et \\' why is it that \\' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d \\' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d \\' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l \\' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l \\' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : \" par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said \" goodbye and good riddancej ! \" me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n\\'t listening closely . \" \" cette construction marquee n \\' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu \\' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l \\' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . \" \" je n \\' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j \\' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d \\' une chose deja mentionnee . \" \" les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l \\' accent sur l \\' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? \" \" ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d \\' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l \\' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . \" \" cette construction met l \\' emphase sur l \\' element interrogatif . \" \" spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l \\' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you \\' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . \" \" la seule raison justifiant l \\' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l \\' emphase qu \\' elle met sur l \\' objet de la question . \" \" en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l \\' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . \" \" la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . \" \" les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c \\' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l \\' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l \\' element interrogatif . \" \" dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? \" \" pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu \\' un vous a donne l \\' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l \\' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . \" toutes ces remarques s \\' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s \\' accompagner d \\' une accentuation de l \\' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d \\' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l \\' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l \\' adverbe interrogatif : \" where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . \" \" where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . \" \" je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . \" \" why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s \\' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger . \" \" toutes ces constructions sont possibles , excepte celle avec how . \" \" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . pour how c \\' est different parce que how is it est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi . donc how is it that you did thisj ? convient si cela signifie pourquoi as-tu fait celaj ? . si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . \" \" les constructions avec what , who et when sont acceptables , mais celles avec how et where ne semblent pas tres naturelles . \" \" toutes les constructions me conviennent ( sauf peut-etre la derniere avec where , qui me para t bizarre ) . \" \" je pense qu \\' il ne serait pas approprie d \\' employer is it that dans aucune des situations mentionnees , excepte why is it that . . \" \" j \\' utiliserais cette construction avec when seulement s \\' il etait suivi de was it ; je ne l \\' emploierais pas avec how et where . \" \" tous les exemples cites sont acceptables mais , mise a part la question avec why ( et peut-etre celle avec how ) , ils ne semblent pas aussi generaux que la question ordinaire [ unmarked ] . \" pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s \\' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n \\' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu \\' il pose porte sur l \\' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t \\' en vasj ? mais * tu t \\' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d \\' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : \" toutes ces phrases s \\' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu \\' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ? \" \" nous formons souvent des enonces come ceux que vous citez , par exemple : who was it who split ink on your book ? why was it that he was late ? who did we say was coming at 8 o \\' clock ? etc . \" \" pour what , who , when et where , je peux employer is it seulement avec le present ; avec le passe je dirais was it . [ pour ] how is it that you did thisj ? , et si je veux vraiment savoir comment , alors le temps doit correspondre comme avec les autres adverbes interrogatifs . \" \" toutes les phrases me conviennent , meme si dans plusieurs cas j \\' ai pense qu \\' il y avait une meilleure alternative : what is it that you said / are saying ? ) aussi : what was it that you said ? who is it that you met / are meeting ? ) aussi : who was it that you met ? when is it that you met / are meeting her ? ) avec \" met \" , \" when was it that you met \" est meilleur . how is it that you did / do this ? ) aussi : how was it that you did that ? where is it that you were / are ? ) avec \" were \" , \" where was it that you were \" est meilleur . \" \" toutes les phrases sont bonnes . elles seraient un peu meilleures si les temps des verbes s \\' accordaient . \" \" les questions conviennent toutes , tant que le temps employe est correct . \" \" quand l \\' anglais emploie l \\' expression is it that , les temps des verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart des cas . \" \" toutes les phrases sont parfaitement correctes , sauf que normalement j \\' accorderais le temps du premier verbe a celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe . par exemple : who was it that you met ? ( but ) who is it that you are meeting ? when was it that you met her ? ( but ) when is it that you are meeting her ? . \" nous pouvons sur ce point differencier les constructions \\' is it that \\' et \\' est-ce que \\' , la construction de l \\' anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ais . en effet , le fran ais n \\' accorderait pas les temps des deux verbes .\\n',\n",

       " 'Subject: summary : whatever happened to \\'d ?\\n\\na few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form \\' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people \\'s attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : \\' better she should n\\'t go \\' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : \" information based syntax and semantics \" ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n\\'t allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) \" auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure \" _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren \\' t as a similar case ( aren \\' t i vs . i aren \\' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting \\' she has to stop \\' ) * \\' has she to stop ? \\' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * \\' had she better stop ? \\' and \\' had n\\'t she better stop ? \\' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler \\' we better had \\' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern \\' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding \\' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag \\' bettern \\' t i ? \\' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion \\' better she go ? \\' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n\\'t know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : \" in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it \\'s certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i \\'d better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n\\'t : you [ b ] better , where there \\'s a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n\\'t seem to exist , except in archaisms like \\' i \\'d liefer do that \\' ( i can\\'t use it , but i \\' ve heard it ) . note also , it \\'s just occurred to me , that you do n\\'t get deletion of - \\'d in * i rather do that . . . \" this last comment i think gives us plenty of scope for more discussion . debbie ziegeler\\n',\n",
       " 'Subject: 8 - bit characters\\n\\ndear fellow linguists : in the past months i have read several postings to this list using languages other than english ( spanish , german , french , finnish , italian , etc . ) . i consider this situation absolutely delicious , as it adds that international flavour that our discipline is so proud of . as english is not my native tongue , i welcome and exercise my right to use my language in all contexts . however , the notorious difficulty that 8 - bit characters have to travel in the cyberspace has made it really hard to send texts that comply with the spelling conventions of these languages ( basically accented and umlauted vowels , greek letters and certain other symbols ) . this is not a big problem when you are just sending a relatively short e-message to a colleague who speaks the same language ( you just drop the accents and type plain vowels or capitals instead , for enye you type a plain \" n \" , etc . ) . the real trouble arises when you wish to send a more polished document such as a paper , an abstract , a conference posting , a bibliography , a draft of a thesis to a distant supervisor , etc . in most of these cases the spelling norms * are * crucial . the obvious solution is the coding of 8 - bit characters as sequences of 7 - bit characters . i think that this has become a common practice , but i do n\\'t know whether there is a standard for these conversions . if this coding practice has not yet been the object of standardisation , i venture to propose one below . this proposal refers to the characters available in the extended character set on ibm pc - compatible computers ( i am not familiar with mac , but this could also be used in that system ) . i would like to stress the fact that it is not necessary to type the ( long ) document using the coding system , rather the file must typed as usual , with accented and umlauted vowels as well as the rest of the characters needed in the language , and just after that you make a copy of the file and on that copy you change the 8 - bit characters for 7 - bit sequences according to the table provided . this procedure is * not * manual , for this you use the search-and - replace facility normally available in your word processor or editor ( remember : the dos editor has it ) . this can be done for most languages in ten or fewer passes ( less than one minute , varying with the size of the file ) . it is important to let the recipient know that you have coded the file in this fashion . append a note at the beginnig of the document to that effect , with a suggestion to use the search-and - replace facility to make the reverse changes , as well as the table of changes and samples . feel free to edit ( and / or translate ) what follows if you wish to make the note shorter by including only what is pertinent for a given language . | a . model of a note :\\n',\n",
